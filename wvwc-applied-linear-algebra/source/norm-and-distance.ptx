    <title>Standard Deviation</title>
    <p>
      Given a vector <m>\xx</m>, we define the <term>de-meaned</term> vector <m>\tilde{\xx}</m> by
      <me>\tilde{\xx} = \xx - \mu\ones</me>
      where
      <me>\mu = \frac{1}{n}\ones^T\xx = \frac{1}{n}\sum_i x_i</me>.
      We then define the <term>standard deviation</term> of the entries of <m>\xx</m> by
      <me>\sigma(\xx) = \frac{\norm{\tilde{\xx}}}{\sqrt{n}}</me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The standard deviation is a measure of the spread of the entries of <m>\xx</m> from the mean of the entries.
      The closer the standard deviation is to <m>0</m>, the less the entries differ from the mean.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example-computing-standard-deviations">
      <title>Computing standard deviations</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Compute the standard deviations for each of the following vectors:
          <me>\xx_1 = \mqty[1 \\ 1 \\ 1], \xx_2 = \mqty[-1 \\ 1 \\ -1], \xx_3 = \mqty[2 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 4]</me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <p>
        The mean <m>\mu</m> and standard deviation <m>\sigma</m> of a vector satisfy the following formula:
        <me>\frac{\norm{\xx}^2}{n} = \mu^2 + \sigma^2</me>.
        The standard deviation also satisfies the following inequality.
      </p>
      <theorem xml:id="theorem-chebyshev-s-inequality">
        <title>Chebyshev's Inequality</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>k</m> entries of <m>\xx</m> satisfy
            <me>\abs{x_i - \mu} > a</me>.
            Then
            <me>\frac{k}{n} \leq (\sigma/a)^2</me>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </theorem>
      <p>
        This inequality can be rearranged to get
        <me>1 - \frac{k}{n} \geq 1 - \frac{\sigma^2}{a^2}</me>.
        The quantity on the left is the ratio of entries of <m>\xx</m> that are within <m>a</m> units of <m>\mu</m>.
        If we write <m>a = \alpha\sigma</m>, the inequality becomes
        <me>1 - \frac{k}{n} \geq 1 - \frac{1}{\alpha^2}</me>.
        For instance, this inequality tells us that the fraction of entries of <m>\xx</m> within two standard deviations (so <m>a = 2\sigma</m>) of the mean <m>\mu</m> is at least
        <me>1 - \frac{1}{2^2} = \frac{3}{4}</me>,
        or at least <m>75\%</m>.
        Conversely, at most <m>25\%</m> of entries are more than two standard deviations away from the mean.
      </p>
    </example>
    <p>
      Octave can compute the standard deviation as follows using the <c>std()</c> command.
    </p>
    <sage language="octave">
      <input>
        x = randn(1,100); # random vector of 100 entries
        std(x, 1) # we need the second argument to normalizr correctly
      </input>

    <example xml:id="example-return-and-risk-of-an-investment">
      <title>Return and risk of an investment</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose that <m>\xx</m> is a vector whose entries represent a <em>time series</em> of returns from an investment over different periods.
          The mean return is <m>\mu = 5\%</m> and the standard deviation (or <em>risk</em>) is <m>\sigma = 2\%</m>.
          What is the largest possible fraction of periods that resulted in a loss?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          A loss is represented by any entry of <m>\xx</m> that is negative: <m>x_i \lt 0</m>.
          Since <m>\mu = 5\%</m>, this happens only if <m>\abs{x_i - \mu} > 5\%</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's how we can use Chebyshev's inequality to estimate the fraction of periods resulting in a loss.
          Recall that the fraction of entries of <m>\xx</m> such that <m>\abs{x_i-\mu} > a</m> satisfies
          <me>\frac{k}{n} \leq \parens{\frac{\sigma}{a}}^2</me>.
          In our case,
          <me>a = \mu = \frac{\mu}{\sigma}\sigma</me>
          and so
          <me>\frac{k}{n} \leq \parens{\frac{\sigma}{\mu}}^2 = \frac{4}{25}</me>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      The standard deviation satisfies the following properties:
      <me>\sigma(\xx+a\ones) = \sigma(\xx)</me>
      and
      <me>\sigma(a\xx) = \abs{a}\sigma(\xx)</me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's occasionally useful to <term>standardize</term> a vector <m>\xx</m> by replacing it with a vector <m>\zz</m> with mean <m>0</m> and standard deviation <m>1</m> by the following formula:
      <me>\zz = \frac{1}{\sigma}\parens{\xx - \mu\ones}</me>.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example-standardizing-a-vector">
      <title>Standardizing a vector</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Standardize the vector
          <me>\xx = \mqty[1 \\ 2 \\ 8 \\ -5 \\ 10 \\ 8]</me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We have <m>\mu = 4, \sigma = 5.1962</m> and so
          <me>\zz = \mqty[-0.5774 \\ -0.3849 \\ 0.7698 \\ -1.7321 \\  1.1547 \\  0.7698]</me>.
