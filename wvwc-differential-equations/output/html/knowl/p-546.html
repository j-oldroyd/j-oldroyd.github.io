<div class="para">For the above example we could try to solve it as we did in Chapter 3: first by finding the complementary solution <span class="process-math">\(x_{c}\)</span> (which isnâ€™t a problem) and then by finding the particular solution <span class="process-math">\(x_{p}\)</span> corresponding to <span class="process-math">\(F_{E}\text{.}\)</span> However, finding <span class="process-math">\(x_{p}\)</span> will not be possible using our previous methods since the function <span class="process-math">\(F_{E}\)</span> is not differentiable everywhere (nor continuous everywhere). We would like to develop a method that lets us solve ODEs that involve discontinuous quantities.</div>
