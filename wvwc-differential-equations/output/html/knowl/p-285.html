<p>For second order ODEs that were nonhomogeneous, linear and had constant coefficients, we found their general solution by first finding the complementary solution <span class="process-math">\(y_{c}\)</span> and then a corresponding particular solution <span class="process-math">\(y_{p}\text{.}\)</span> The general solution was then <span class="process-math">\(y=y_{c}+y_{p}\text{.}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y_{c}\)</span> was found by solving the corresponding homogeneous equation and we used the method of undetermined coefficients to find <span class="process-math">\(y_{p}\text{.}\)</span> Although we are now looking at higher order ODEs, the method of undetermined coefficients remains unchanged.</p>
