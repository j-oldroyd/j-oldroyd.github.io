<p>To get the other solution, we'll make another guess: whatever it happens to be, it should look quite a bit like the first solution <span class="process-math">\(e^{-x}\text{,}\)</span> since it still needs to cancel out with its derivatives the same way that <span class="process-math">\(e^{-x}\)</span> does. The easiest way to get a function that looks like <span class="process-math">\(e^{-x}\)</span> but is still linearly independent from <span class="process-math">\(e^{-x}\)</span> is to just multiply by <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> In other words, we'll guess (and check!) that <span class="process-math">\(y_{2} = xe^{-x}\)</span> is another solution of <span class="process-math">\(y''+2y^\prime+y = 0\text{.}\)</span> If we plug <span class="process-math">\(y_{2}\)</span> into the ODE, we get</p>

<p class="continuation">which shows that <span class="process-math">\(y_{2}\)</span> is indeed a solution of the ODE. Since it's also linearly independent (which we can check via the Wronskian), this means that the general solution of <span class="process-math">\(y''+2y^\prime+y=0\)</span> is</p>
