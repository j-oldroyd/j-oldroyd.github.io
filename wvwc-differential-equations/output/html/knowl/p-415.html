<div class="para">Critical points of systems are important because they can represent long-term behavior of a system. For example, if we have a first-order system representing the population of two species, and it turns out the the origin is asymptotically stable, then this suggests that both species could be driven to extinction. So we want to classify critical points for nonlinear systems in addition to what we have already for linear systems; unfortunately, nonlinear systems are often difficult, if not outright impossible, to solve exactly.</div>
