<p>Consider a rod that's recently been pulled out of the oven and is now cooling in a room. Let <span class="process-math">\(T(t)\)</span> denote the temperature of the rod at time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> represents the amount of time since the rod was pulled out of the oven. Then we can model <span class="process-math">\(T(t)\)</span> by using Newton's Law of Cooling, which states that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T-A),
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">where <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is a positive constant and <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> represents the ambient temperature of the room. This is an ordinary differential equation since it involves only one independent variable (<span class="process-math">\(t\)</span>).</p>
