<div class="para">Recall that in Chapter 2, the general solution of <span class="process-math">\(ay''+by'+cy=0\)</span> could be obtained by finding <em class="emphasis">two</em> linearly independent solutions <span class="process-math">\(y_{1},y_{2}\text{.}\)</span> The general solution was then <span class="process-math">\(y = c_{1}y_{1}+c_{2}y_{2}\)</span> (which is guaranteed to be a solution by <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-the-superposition-principle.html" title="Theorem 2.1.6: The Superposition Principle">TheoremÂ 2.1.6</a> where <span class="process-math">\(c_{1},c_{2}\)</span> are arbitrary constants. Similarly, the general solution of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/equation-constant-coeffs.html" title="Equation 5">(5)</a> is found by obtaining <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> linearly independent solutions <span class="process-math">\(y_{1},\dots,y_{n}\text{.}\)</span> The general solution in this case is now <span class="process-math">\(y = \sum_{i=1}^{n}c_{i}y_{i}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(c_{i},1\leq i\leq n\)</span> are arbitrary constants. Our main tool for showing that a collection <span class="process-math">\(\{y_{1},\dots,y_{n}\}\)</span> of solutions is in fact linearly independent is again the <em class="emphasis">Wronskian</em>.</div>
