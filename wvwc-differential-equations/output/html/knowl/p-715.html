<p>Now, <span class="process-math">\(X(0)=0\)</span> forces <span class="process-math">\(c_{2} = 0\text{,}\)</span> so we get <span class="process-math">\(X(x) = c_{1}\sinh\mu x\text{.}\)</span> However, since <span class="process-math">\(X(L) = 0\)</span> as well, we get <span class="process-math">\(c_{1}\sinh\mu L = 0\text{.}\)</span> But the only way to solve this is to set <span class="process-math">\(c_{1} = 0\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(\sinh u = 0\)</span> only if <span class="process-math">\(u=0\text{.}\)</span> So in other words, if we assume that <span class="process-math">\(k = \mu^{2}\gt0\text{,}\)</span> then the only way to solve <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/equation-separation-of-variables-1.html" title="Equation 4">(4)</a> is to set <span class="process-math">\(X(x) = 0\text{,}\)</span> which also forces <span class="process-math">\(u(x,t) = 0\text{.}\)</span> Obviously, this isn't very useful. Similarly, if we assume that <span class="process-math">\(k=0\)</span> then we get the same problem. So let's assume that <span class="process-math">\(k=-\mu^{2}\lt0\)</span> for some nonzero <span class="process-math">\(\mu\text{.}\)</span> Then <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/equation-separation-of-variables-1.html" title="Equation 4">(4)</a> becomes <span class="process-math">\(X''+\mu^{2}X = 0\text{,}\)</span> which has solution</p>
