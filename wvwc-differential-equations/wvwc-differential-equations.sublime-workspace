If you have no idea what I'm talking about then\n  check it out (http://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge) it's great! (Just search for diff3 on the page)\n\n  Some clarification:\n  The first block always represents \"our\" while the last block is always \"theirs\".\n\n  Configuration\n  -------------\n\n  To configure the plugin you can use a user-settings file in your user folder. You can easily access this file other \"Preferences\" -> \"Git Conflict Resolver\" -> \"Settings - User\".\n\n  For information on which settings are available take a look at the commented default-settings file:\n\n  {\n      // The git path\n      // by default the plugin assumes that git is in your path\n      \"git_path\": \"git\",\n\n      // Enable or disable the live matching of conflict areas\n      // By default the plugin matches live\n      \"live_matching\": true,\n\n      // The color of the highlighting is called \"scope\" in Sublime Text,\n      // to change this color you can choose a different scope.\n      // This customization isn't easy, since you have to define your own\n      // scope in your theme file.\n      \"matching_scope\": \"invalid\",\n\n      // This option enables the filling the conflict area with a color\n      // By default the area will just be outlined\n      \"fill_conflict_area\": false,\n\n      // This option enables the outline of the conflict area\n      // By default the area will just be outlined\n      // In Sublime Text 2 the area will only be outlined if \"fill_conflict_area\" is false\n      \"outline_conflict_area\": true,\n\n      // This options enable the gutter marks for the different conflict groups\n      \"ours_gutter\": true,\n      \"theirs_gutter\": true,\n      \"ancestor_gutter\": true,\n\n      // This option changes the display of the \"Show Conflict Files\" functionality\"\n      // true: Show only the filesnames (\"src/main.js\" becomes \"main.js\")\n      // false: Show relative path (from the root of the repository)\n      // By default Git Conflict Resolver only shows the filename\n      \"show_only_filename\": true\n  }\n\n  Shortcuts\n  ---------\n\n  There are no default shortcuts, to add them open your user keybindings file and add a keybinding like the following:\n\n  { \"keys\": [\"ctrl+alt+f\"], \"command\": \"find_next_conflict\" },\n  { \"keys\": [\"ctrl+alt+o\"], \"command\": \"keep\", \"args\": { \"keep\": \"ours\" } },\n  { \"keys\": [\"ctrl+alt+t\"], \"command\": \"keep\", \"args\": { \"keep\": \"theirs\" } },\n  { \"keys\": [\"ctrl+alt+a\"], \"command\": \"keep\", \"args\": { \"keep\": \"ancestor\" } },\n  { \"keys\": [\"ctrl+alt+c\"], \"command\": \"list_conflict_files\" }\n\nNeon Color Scheme\n-----------------\n\n  Neon Color Scheme\n  +++++++++++++++++\n\n  Thank you for installing my Neon Color Scheme! I hope you enjoy using it as much\n  as I enjoyed creating it. It looks best when used with a dark UI theme - I use\n  SodaReloaded Dark, but there are many other excellent ones available on Package\n  Control.\n\n  To activate, add this line to your user settings:\n\n      \"color_scheme\": \"Packages/Neon Color Scheme/Neon.sublime-color-scheme\",\n\n  Or, select `Preferences → Color Scheme…` and choose \"Neon\" from the list.\n\n  If you have any questions, concerns, bugs, improvement suggestions, or anything\n  else, feel free to open an issue on Github and I'll do my best to help you out.\n  You can also find me on the Twitters, monitoring the Sublime tags on Stack\n  Overflow, and hanging out on the Sublime Discord server.\n\n      @MattDMo\n\n  https://github.com/MattDMo/Neon-color-scheme\n\nMarkdownEditing\n---------------\n\n  # MarkdownEditing\n\n  Thanks for installing MarkdownEditing.\n\n  This package provides \n\n  *   useful Markdown editing features for Sublime Text \n  *   color schemes optimized for writing\n  *   robust syntax definitions for\n      -   Standard Markdown\n      -   Github flavored Markdown\n      -   MultiMarkdown\n\n  User Guide is available at https://sublimetext-markdown.github.io/MarkdownEditing\n\n  Bugs or feedback via https://github.com/SublimeText-Markdown/MarkdownEditing/issues\n\nExalt\n-----\n\n  Exalt\n  =====\n\n  A plugin for validating XML and formatting XML and HTML. For information on\n  what the plugin can do, see:\n\n  https://github.com/eerohele/exalt\n\n  To get full benefit of the plugin, you'll probably want to use an XML catalog.\n\n  If you already have one or more catalog files, you can tell Exalt to use them.\n  Add an entry like this into User/Exalt.sublime-settings:\n\n  {\n    \"xml_catalog_files\": [\n      \"/path/to/my/xml/catalog.xml\", \"/path/to/my/other/catalog.xml\"\n    ]\n  }\n\n  NOTE: Every time you modify the \"xml_catalog_files\" setting, you have to restart\n  Sublime Text 3 for the changes to take effect.\n\n  If you don't have an XML catalog, you can install one by using my\n  \"catalogs\" GitHub repository at:\n\n  https://github.com/eerohele/catalogs\n\n  Remember to set the \"xml_catalog_files\" setting to point to the catalog.xml\n  in the repo and restart Sublime Text 3.\n\nSublimeLinter\n-------------\n\n\n    ____        _     _ _                _     _       _\n   / ___| _   _| |__ | (_)_ __ ___   ___| |   (_)_ __ | |_ ___ _ __\n   \\___ \\| | | | '_ \\| | | '_ ` _ \\ / _ \\ |   | | '_ \\| __/ _ \\ '__|\n    ___) | |_| | |_) | | | | | | | |  __/ |___| | | | | ||  __/ |\n   |____/ \\__,_|_.__/|_|_|_| |_| |_|\\___|_____|_|_| |_|\\__\\___|_|\n\n\n  Welcome to SublimeLinter, a linter framework for Sublime Text.\n\n  Linters are not included, they must be installed separately.\n  Get them from Package Control: https://packagecontrol.io/search/SublimeLinter\n\n\n  For complete documentation on how to use and configure SublimeLinter,\n  please see: http://www.sublimelinter.com\n\n  To report issues: https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter\n\nSublimeLinter-contrib-mlint\n---------------------------\n\n  SublimeLinter-mlint\n  -------------------------------\n  This linter plugin for SublimeLinter provides an interface to mlint.\n\n  ** IMPORTANT! **\n\n  Before this plugin will activate, you *must*\n  follow the installation instructions here:\n\n  https://github.com/rdeits/SublimeLinter-contrib-mlint\n\nMarkdownPreview\n---------------\n\n  [![Build][github-ci-image]][github-ci-link]\n  [![Package Control Downloads][pc-image]][pc-link]\n  ![License][license-image]\n\n  # Markdown Preview\n\n  Preview and build your markdown files quickly in your web browser using [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) 3.\n\n  You can use the builtin [Python Markdown][pymd] parser (offline) or use the [GitHub Markdown API][gfm-api] or [GitLab Markdown API][glfm-api] (online) for the conversion.\n\n  ## Features\n\n  - Markdown preview using the [python-markdown][pymd] with syntax highlighting via Pygments and optional 3rd party extensions ([pymdown-extensions][pymdownx-docs] included by default).\n  - Markdown previews via the GitHub API.\n  - Markdown previews via the GitLab API thanks to [@hadisfr][hadisfr].\n  - Ability use other external Markdown parsers.\n  - Build markdown file using Sublime Text build system.\n  - Browser preview auto reload on save if you have the [LiveReload plugin][live-reload] installed.\n  - Configurable CSS and JavaScript assets with overriding if needed.\n  - YAML support thanks to [@tommi][tommi].\n  - Clipboard selection and copy to clipboard thanks to [@hexatrope][hexatrope].\n  - MathJax support : `\\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\)` thanks to [@bps10][bps10].\n  - HTML template customization thanks to [@hozaka][hozaka].\n  - Embed images as base64.\n  - Strip out MultiMarkdown CriticMarkup.\n\n  ## Documentation\n\n  https://facelessuser.github.io/MarkdownPreview/\n\n  ## Support\n\n  - Any bugs about Markdown Preview please feel free to report [here][issue].\n  - And you are welcome to fork and submit pull requests.\n\n  ## Attribution\n\n  Markdown Preview contains a stripped down version of font awesome that is included in the default non-GitHub CSS.

If you have no idea what I'm talking about then\n  check it out (http://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge) it's great! (Just search for diff3 on the page)\n\n  Some clarification:\n  The first block always represents \"our\" while the last block is always \"theirs\".\n\n  Configuration\n  -------------\n\n  To configure the plugin you can use a user-settings file in your user folder. You can easily access this file other \"Preferences\" -> \"Git Conflict Resolver\" -> \"Settings - User\".\n\n  For information on which settings are available take a look at the commented default-settings file:\n\n  {\n      // The git path\n      // by default the plugin assumes that git is in your path\n      \"git_path\": \"git\",\n\n      // Enable or disable the live matching of conflict areas\n      // By default the plugin matches live\n      \"live_matching\": true,\n\n      // The color of the highlighting is called \"scope\" in Sublime Text,\n      // to change this color you can choose a different scope.\n      // This customization isn't easy, since you have to define your own\n      // scope in your theme file.\n      \"matching_scope\": \"invalid\",\n\n      // This option enables the filling the conflict area with a color\n      // By default the area will just be outlined\n      \"fill_conflict_area\": false,\n\n      // This option enables the outline of the conflict area\n      // By default the area will just be outlined\n      // In Sublime Text 2 the area will only be outlined if \"fill_conflict_area\" is false\n      \"outline_conflict_area\": true,\n\n      // This options enable the gutter marks for the different conflict groups\n      \"ours_gutter\": true,\n      \"theirs_gutter\": true,\n      \"ancestor_gutter\": true,\n\n      // This option changes the display of the \"Show Conflict Files\" functionality\"\n      // true: Show only the filesnames (\"src/main.js\" becomes \"main.js\")\n      // false: Show relative path (from the root of the repository)\n      // By default Git Conflict Resolver only shows the filename\n      \"show_only_filename\": true\n  }\n\n  Shortcuts\n  ---------\n\n  There are no default shortcuts, to add them open your user keybindings file and add a keybinding like the following:\n\n  { \"keys\": [\"ctrl+alt+f\"], \"command\": \"find_next_conflict\" },\n  { \"keys\": [\"ctrl+alt+o\"], \"command\": \"keep\", \"args\": { \"keep\": \"ours\" } },\n  { \"keys\": [\"ctrl+alt+t\"], \"command\": \"keep\", \"args\": { \"keep\": \"theirs\" } },\n  { \"keys\": [\"ctrl+alt+a\"], \"command\": \"keep\", \"args\": { \"keep\": \"ancestor\" } },\n  { \"keys\": [\"ctrl+alt+c\"], \"command\": \"list_conflict_files\" }"
