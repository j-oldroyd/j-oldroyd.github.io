<p>Direction fields are useful because they provide a means to obtain information about a differential equation (and the corresponding model) without actually having to solve the differential equation. This is often done by drawing a <dfn class="terminology">solution curve</dfn> through a direction field, which represents a solution of an initial value problem corresponding to the ODE the direction field is drawn from. To draw a solution curve, just pick a point in the direction field and follow along the slopes as best you can.</p>
