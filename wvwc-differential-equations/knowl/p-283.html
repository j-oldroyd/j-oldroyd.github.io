<p>For second order ODEs that were nonhomogeneous, linear and had constant coefficients, we found their general solution by first finding the complementary solution \(y_{c}\) and then a corresponding particular solution \(y_{p}\text{.}\) The general solution was then \(y=y_{c}+y_{p}\text{.}\) \(y_{c}\) was found by solving the corresponding homogeneous equation\sidenote{\(ay''+by'+cy=0\)} and we used the method of undetermined coefficients to find \(y_{p}\text{.}\) Although we are now looking at higher order ODEs, the method of undetermined coefficients remains unchanged.</p>
