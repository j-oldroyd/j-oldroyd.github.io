<p>Let \(T(t)\) denote the temperature of the plate \(t\) minutes after being removed from the oven and let \(A(t)\) denote the temperature of the room \(t\) minutes after the plate is removed from the oven. Then \(T(0) = 100\) and Newton's Law of Cooling says that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\dv{T}{t} = k(T-15).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>To answer this question we need to find \(T\text{,}\) and although we don't know \(k\) at the moment we can still make some progress just by remembering that it's a constant. This ODE is separable, so we'll separate variables and integrate both sides to get</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\ln(T-15) = kt+C
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which simplifies to \(T-15 = C_{1}e^{kt}\) or just \(T = 15+C_{1}e^{kt}\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Now we need to find \(C_{1}\) and \(k\text{.}\) To find \(C_{1}\text{,}\) we just use the initial condition to get \(C_{1} = 85\text{.}\) The only piece of information that we have left to find \(k\) is the fact that the temperature of the plate drops to \(90\) after \(20\) minutes. In other words, \(T(20) = 90\text{.}\) Therefore</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
90 = 15+85e^{20k}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which becomes</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\ln\frac{75}{85} = 20k\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Therefore \(k = \frac{1}{20}\ln\frac{15}{17}\approx-.006.\)</p>
<p>So, finally, \(T(t) = 15+85e^{-.006t}\) and the temperature after five hours is \(T(300)\approx28\text{.}\)</p>
