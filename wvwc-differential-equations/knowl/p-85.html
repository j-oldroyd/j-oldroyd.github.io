<p>A common application of first-order linear ODEs is in modeling "mixture" problems. Suppose we have a tank which contains a solution (mixture of solute and solvent, such as salt and water). Some amount of solution is also flowing into and out of the tank. We want to measure the amount of solute in the tank at time \(t\text{,}\) call this amount \(x(t)\text{.}\) Then \(x(t)\) will change depending on how the solute flows into and out of the tank, making it a prime target for a differential equation.</p>
