<p>The first step to solving this IVP is to solve the ODE \(y' = x+4xy^{2}\text{.}\) It may not look like it at first, but this ODE is separable since we can rewrite it as \(y' = x(1+4y^{2})\text{.}\) To solve this ODE, we need to move the \(y\) terms to the left hand side of the equation and the \(x\) terms to the right hand side. We'll abuse notation a little bit to do so by rewriting \(y' = \dv{y}{x}\) and treating \(\dv{y}{x}\) as a fraction, but it won't get us into too much trouble here:</p>
