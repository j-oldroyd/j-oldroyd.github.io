<p>Consider a rod that's recently been pulled out of the oven and is now cooling in a room. Let \(T(t)\) denote the temperature of the rod at time \(t\text{,}\) where \(t\) represents the amount of time since the rod was pulled out of the oven. Then we can model \(T(t)\) by using Newton's Law of Cooling, which states that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T-A),
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where \(k\) is a positive constant and \(A\) represents the ambient temperature of the room. This is an ordinary differential equation since it involves only one independent variable (\(t\)).</p>
