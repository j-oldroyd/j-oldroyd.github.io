<p>is a solution of <a knowl="./knowl/equation-wave-equation.html" title="Equation 6.2.1">(6.2.1)</a> subject to the boundary conditions <a knowl="./knowl/equation-boundary-conditions.html" title="Equation 6.2.2">(6.2.2)</a>. It also follows from the superposition principle that any (finite) linear combination of these functions will give another solution that satisfies the boundary conditions. However, this does <em class="emphasis">not</em> guarantee that we can solve for the initial conditions in <a knowl="./knowl/equation-initial-condition.html" title="Equation 6.2.3">(6.2.3)</a>. To give ourselves as general a solution as possible, we will guess that the solution to the wave equation is actually a linear combination of all possible \(u_{n}\text{.}\) That is, we'll say that</p>
