<p>To get the other solution, we'll make another guess: whatever it happens to be, it should look quite a bit like the first solution \(e^{-x}\text{,}\) since it still needs to cancel out with its derivatives the same way that \(e^{-x}\) does. The easiest way to get a function that looks like \(e^{-x}\) but is still linearly independent from \(e^{-x}\) is to just multiply by \(x\text{.}\) In other words, we'll guess (and check!) that \(y_{2} = xe^{-x}\) is another solution of \(y''+2y'+y = 0\text{.}\) If we plug \(y_{2}\) into the ODE, we get</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
y''_{2} + 2y'_{2} + y_{2} \amp = \underbrace{-2e^{-x} + xe^{-x}}_{y''_{2}} + \underbrace{2e^{-x} - 2xe^{-x}}_{y'_{2}} + \underbrace{xe^{-x}}_{y_{2}} \\
\amp = 0, 
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>which shows that \(y_{2}\) is indeed a solution of the ODE. Since it's also linearly independent (which we can check via the Wronskian), this means that the general solution of \(y''+2y'+y=0\) is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
y = c_{1}y_{1} + c_{2}y_{2} = c_{1}e^{-x} + c_{2}xe^{-x}. 
\end{equation*}
