<p>First, note that the ODE is indeed a first-order linear ODE since it takes the form given in <a data-knowl="./knowl/definition-first-order-linear-odes.html" title="Definition 1.4.1: First-Order Linear ODEs">DefinitionÂ 1.4.1</a>. If we stare at the ODE for a bit, we might think that the left hand side looks like something we'd get after using the product rule. Just compare \((fg)' = fg'+f'g\) with \(\dv{y}{x}+2y\text{,}\) and it appears that the unknown function \(y\) is taking the place of \(g\) in the product rule formula. If we could just figure out what the function \(f\) is supposed to be, then we could drastically simplify the left hand side of the ODE.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no such function \(f\) that works here. If there were, we'd have to have \(f'=2\) and \(f=2x\text{,}\) and clearly we aren't multiplying \(\dv{y}{x}\) by \(2x\) in the ODE. But we can pull a dirty trick here! We'll multiply through the ODE by \(e^{2x}\) to get the new ODE</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
e^{2x}\dv{y}{x}+2e^{2x}y = xe^{2x}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>It might not be all that obvious why this helps us out, but now the left hand side can be simplified by the product rule:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
e^{2x}\dv{y}{x}+2e^{2x}y = \dv{}{x}[e^{2x}y].
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>So we can rewrite the entire ODE as</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\dv{}{x}[e^{2x}y] = xe^{2x}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We can integrate this on both sides to get \(e^{2x}y = \int xe^{2x}\,dx\text{,}\) or just</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
e^{2x}y = \frac{1}{2}xe^{2x} - \frac{1}{4}e^{2x}+C.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The explicit solution would be \(y = \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{1}{4} + Ce^{-2x}\text{.}\)</p>
