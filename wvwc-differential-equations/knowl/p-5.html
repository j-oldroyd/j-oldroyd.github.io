<p>A <dfn class="terminology">differential equation</dfn> is an equation relating some function with its derivatives. A differential equation that involves a function of only one independent variable is called an <dfn class="terminology">ordinary differential equation</dfn>, or ODE. A differential equation that involves a function of more than one independent variable (which you see a lot of in Calculus 3) is called a <dfn class="terminology">partial differential equation</dfn>, or PDE, and will be studied in more detail in <a href="partial-differential-equations.html" class="xref" title="Chapter 6: Partial Differential Equations">ChapterÂ 6</a>. The <dfn class="terminology">order</dfn> of a differential equation is the highest derivative that appears in the equation.</p>
