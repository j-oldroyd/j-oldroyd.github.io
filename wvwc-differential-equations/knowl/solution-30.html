<p>Let \(x(t)\) denote the position of the mass \(t\) seconds after being released, so that \(x(0) = -5\) and \(x'(0) = 0\text{.}\) We could find the time it takes for the mass to return to its starting position by first finding \(x(t)\text{,}\) but a quicker way is to just find the period \(T\) of \(x\text{.}\) To do this, we must find the circular frequency \(\omega_{0} = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\text{.}\) Thankfully, half of the work is done for us (we know \(m=5\)), so we only need the value of \(k\) which itself comes from Hooke's Law.</p>
<p>Call the spring force \(F_{S}\) and recall that \(F_{S} = -kx\text{.}\) We know that it takes a force of <span class="quantity">10 N</span> to hold the mass still at \(x=-5\text{.}\) The spring force must <em class="emphasis">precisely</em> counterbalance this force in order for the mass to remain still as it's held, which means that \(F_{S} = 10\) since \(F_{S}\) pulls the mass to the right. Therefore \(-k(-5) = 10\) and so \(k=2\text{,}\) which gives \(\omega_{0} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{5}}\text{.}\) This means that the period of motion is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega_{0}} = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{5}{2}}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>To find \(x(t)\text{,}\) we'll use the fact that it can be written as \(x = C\cos(\omega_{0}t-\varphi)\text{.}\) Since \(C = 5\) (because the mass can never go more than five meters from the equilibrium position) and we already know that \(\omega_{0} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{5}}\text{,}\) we just need to find \(\varphi\text{.}\) We can just make use of the initial condition \(x(0) = -5\) to get this:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
-5 = C\cos\varphi = 5\cos\varphi
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>and so we can choose \(\varphi=\pi\text{.}\) Hence</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
x(t) = 5\cos(\sqrt{\frac{2}{5}}t-\pi).
\end{equation*}
