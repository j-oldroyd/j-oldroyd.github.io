<p>Two brine tanks are set up as in <a knowl="./knowl/figure-interconnected-tanks.html" title="Figure 4.1.3">Figure 4.1.3</a>. Fresh water flows into the tank at a rate of \(r_{1}\text{,}\) well-mixed solution flows from Tank 1 to Tank 2 at a rate of \(r_{2}\) and well-mixed solution flows out of Tank 2 at a rate of \(r_{3}\text{.}\) Suppose that \(r_{1}, r_{2}\) and  \(r_{3}\) are 5 <sup>gal</sup>⁄<sub>min</sub>, the volume of solution in Tank 1 is 10 gal and the volume of solution in Tank 2 is 7 gal. Suppose Tank 1 has 5 lb of salt at time \(t=0\) and Tank 2 has 2 lb of salt at time \(t=0\text{.}\) Set up a first-order system that describes the amount of salt in each tank at time \(t\text{.}\)</p>
