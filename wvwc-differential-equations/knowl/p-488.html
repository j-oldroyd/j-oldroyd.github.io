<p>For the above example we could try to solve it as we did in Chapter 3: first by finding the complementary solution \(x_{c}\) (which isn't a problem) and then by finding the particular solution \(x_{p}\) corresponding to \(F_{E}\text{.}\) However, finding \(x_{p}\) will not be possible using our previous methods since the function \(F_{E}\) is not differentiable everywhere (nor continuous everywhere). We would like to develop a method that lets us solve ODEs that involve discontinuous quantities.</p>
