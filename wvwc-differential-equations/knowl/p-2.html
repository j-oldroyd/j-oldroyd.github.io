<p>The field of <dfn class="terminology">differential equations</dfn> attempts to answer such questions by providing a model for the quantity of interest using information about its rate of change, which is sometimes easier to obtain than information about the quantity itself. Once we know enough about how a quantity changes, we hope to make a decent estimate for how the quantity actually behaves. There are actually two different types of differential equations that we will look at in this course. The first is the ordinary differential equation.</p>
