<p>The general solution takes the form \(y = y_{c}+y_{p}\text{,}\) where \(y_{c}\) is a solution of the associated homogeneous equation \(y^{(3)}-y'=0\) and \(y_{p}\) is a single solution of the original ODE \(y^{(3)}-y'=\sinh 2x\text{.}\) Since the characteristic equation of \(y^{(3)}-y'=0\) is \(r^{3}-r=0\text{,}\) we get</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
y_{c} = c_{1}+c_{2}e^{x}+c_{3}e^{-x} = c_{1}+A\cosh x+B\sinh x.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Now we'll find \(y_{p}\text{.}\) Since the right hand side of the ODE is \(\sinh 2x\text{,}\) a good initial guess would be \(y_{p} = C\sinh 2x\text{.}\) However, when we take this guess and plug it into the ODE, we'll start seeing terms involving \(\cosh 2x\) as well (since \(\frac{d}{dx}\sinh 2x = 2\cosh 2x\)) so this means we'll want to include \(\cosh 2x\) into our guess for \(y_{p}\) also. So we'll modify our guess to be \(y_{p} = C\cosh 2x+D\sinh 2x\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Since our guess for \(y_{p}\) doesn't overlap with \(y_{c}\text{,}\) we can proceed with plugging our guess into the original ODE \(y^{(3)}-y'=\sinh 2x\) and equating coefficients, just as we did before.</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\sinh 2x \amp= y^{(3)}_{p}-y'_{p}\\
\amp= \parens{8C\sinh2x+8D\cosh2x}-\parens{2C\sinh2x+2D\cosh2x}\\
\amp= 6C\sinh2x+6D\cosh2x.
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>So we get \(C = \frac{1}{6}\) and \(D=0\text{,}\) which means that \(y_{p} = \frac{1}{6}\cosh2x\text{.}\) When solving for \(y_{p}\text{,}\) always remember to plug the values you find back into the guess for \(y_{p}\) that you used! So the general solution of the ODE is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
y = c_{1}+A\cosh x+B\sinh x+\frac{1}{6}\cosh2x.
\end{equation*}
