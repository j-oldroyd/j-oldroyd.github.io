<p>Recall that in Chapter 2, the general solution of \(ay''+by'+cy=0\) could be obtained by finding <em class="emphasis">two</em> linearly independent solutions \(y_{1},y_{2}\text{.}\) The general solution was then \(y = c_{1}y_{1}+c_{2}y_{2}\) (which is guaranteed to be a solution by <a data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-the-superposition-principle.html" title="Theorem 2.1.6: The Superposition Principle">TheoremÂ 2.1.6</a> where \(c_{1},c_{2}\) are arbitrary constants. Similarly, the general solution of <a data-knowl="./knowl/equation-constant-coeffs.html" title="Equation 3.1.1">(3.1.1)</a> is found by obtaining \(n\) linearly independent solutions \(y_{1},\dots,y_{n}\text{.}\) The general solution in this case is now \(y = \sum_{i=1}^{n}c_{i}y_{i}\text{,}\) where \(c_{i},1\leq i\leq n\) are arbitrary constants. Our main tool for showing that a collection \(\{y_{1},\dots,y_{n}\}\) of solutions is in fact linearly independent is again the <em class="emphasis">Wronskian</em>.</p>
