<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Now let's make things a little more interesting. Suppose we wanted to solve the ODE \(\dv{y}{x} = e^{-x^{2}}\text{.}\) Then this is <em class="emphasis">impossible</em> to do in a single "closed-form". <aside class="aside aside-like"><p>By closed-form we basically mean in terms of the usual exponential, trigonometric and polynomial functions, as well as their inverses.</p></aside> This is because solving this ODE requires integrating \(e^{-x^{2}}\text{,}\) which as you may remember from Calculus 2 cannot be done without resorting to something like power series. Even if we can't solve the ODE, or if we can't solve it easily, we still want to be able to obtain some information from it. One way to do this is by using <dfn class="terminology">direction fields</dfn>, which is a graphical representation of the ODE.</p>
