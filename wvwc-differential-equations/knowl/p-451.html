<p>We can add a few more restrictions to these ODEs to help us solve them. Note that the boundary conditions <a knowl="./knowl/equation-boundary-conditions.html" title="Equation 6.2.2">(6.2.2)</a> force either \(X(0) = X(L) = 0\) or \(T(t) = 0\) for all \(t\text{,}\) which leads to \(u(x,t) = 0\text{.}\) So to avoid this trivial solution, we'll set \(X(0) = X(L) = 0\text{.}\) The solutions of these equations depend on \(k\text{.}\) We'll solve <a knowl="./knowl/equation-separation-of-variables-1.html" title="Equation 6.2.4">(6.2.4)</a> first since we have extra information to use. So to start, suppose that \(k&gt;0\) and write \(k = \mu^{2}\) for some nonzero \(\mu\text{.}\) Then <a knowl="./knowl/equation-separation-of-variables-1.html" title="Equation 6.2.4">(6.2.4)</a> becomes \(X''-\mu^{2}X = 0\) and has solution given by</p>
