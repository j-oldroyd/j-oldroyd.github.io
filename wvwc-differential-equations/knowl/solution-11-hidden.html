<p>This ODE is not separable and we can't just integrate it (since the right hand side depends on the dependent variable). However, the form of the right hand side suggests a substitution: \(u = x+y+3\text{.}\) This would simplify things quite a bit, leaving us with \(y'=u^{2}\text{.}\) The only problem with this is that \(y'\) depends on \(x\text{,}\) not \(u\text{.}\) We must rewrite \(y'\) in terms of the new variable \(u\text{,}\) which isn't too bad. Since \(u = x+y+3\text{,}\) we get \(y' = u'-1\text{.}\) Therefore the ODE becomes</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
u'-1 = u^{2}\text{ or just }\dv{u}{x} = 1+u^{2}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>This new ODE <em class="emphasis">is</em> separable, and so we separate variables and integrate to get \(\tan^{-1}u = x+C\text{.}\) If we don't care about finding an explicit solution, then we can just replace \(u\) to get the equation back in terms of \(y\text{.}\) So our (implicit) general solution is \(\tan^{-1}(x+y+3) = x+C\text{.}\)</p>
