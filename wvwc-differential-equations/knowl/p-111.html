<p><a knowl="./knowl/example-population-explosion.html" title="Example 1.6.2: Population Explosion">ExampleÂ 1.6.2</a> shows that we need to be more careful with our assumptions on population growth. One relatively simple assumption we can make is to assume that the birth rate \(\beta(t)\) decreases as population \(P\) increases. This makes sense in the physical world as well: as population increases, existing and finite resources (such as food) must be shared between more and more members of the population. Since there's less to go around, we should expect growth to slow down. In particular, let's assume that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\beta(t) &amp; = \beta_{0} - \beta_{1}P \\
\delta(t) &amp; = \delta_{0} 
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>where \(\beta_{0},\beta_{1}\) and \(\delta_{0}\) are all positive constants. Then the population equation for this scenario becomes</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\dv{P}{t} = (\beta_{0} - \beta_{1}P - \delta_{0})P.
\end{equation*}
