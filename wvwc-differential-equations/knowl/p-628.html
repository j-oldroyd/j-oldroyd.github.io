<p>This works just fine as a simple model of the temperature of the rod, but in reality the situation is likely to be more complicated. For instance, the temperature of the rod will likely vary over the surface of the rod at any given time \(t\text{.}\) So it's reasonable to assume that the temperature of the rod should depend on <em class="emphasis">two</em> variables, say, \(x\) (position on the rod) and \(t\) (time). So the temperature of the rod would be more accurately described by a function \(u(x,t)\text{.}\) In fact, as we will see later, the temperature \(u(x,t)\) can be described by the <dfn class="terminology">heat equation</dfn>:</p>
