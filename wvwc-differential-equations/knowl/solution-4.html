<p>It may not be obvious that Newton's Law of Cooling can be restated as a differential equation, but the phrase "rate of change" that appears in the statement of the law is a good clue that this can be done. To do this, first we need to give the relevant quantities (the temperature of the object and the temperature of the surrounding medium) names. Let \(T(t)\) denote the temperature of the object at time \(t\) and let \(A(t)\) denote the temperature of the surrounding medium at time \(t\text{.}\) Then Newton's Law of Cooling says that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\dv{T}{t} = k(T-A)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where \(k\) is some constant.</p>
<p>Although we can't determine \(k\) precisely (this would require experimentation and depends on the object and medium in question), we can still say something useful about it. In particular, \(k\) must be negative. To see why, consider what the object does if \(T\gt A\) and \(T\lt A\text{.}\) If \(T\gt A\text{,}\) then the object must be cooling since the surrounding medium is cooler than the object. If the object is cooling, then \(\dv{T}{t}\lt0\text{.}\) On the other hand, if \(T\lt A\) then \(\dv{T}{t}\gt0\) since the object would be heating up in this case. The only way for this to occur is if \(k\lt0\text{.}\)</p>
