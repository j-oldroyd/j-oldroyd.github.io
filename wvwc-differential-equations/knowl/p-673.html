<p>With this viewpoint, we can assign physical reasoning to the heat and wave equations:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>The heat equation states that the time rate of change of the temperature is proportional to the difference between the temperature at \((x,t)\) and the average values of nearby temperatures. If the nearby average temperature is greater (i.e., the Laplacian is positive), then the temperature will increase.</p></li>
<li><p>The wave equation states that the acceleration of the wave height is proportional to the difference between the height of the wave at \((x,t)\) and the average height at nearby points. If the nearby average height is greater (i.e., the Laplacian is positive), then the wave height will accelerate upwards.</p></li>
