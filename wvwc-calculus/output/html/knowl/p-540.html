<p>Here, it doesn't make much difference what we select for <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(dv\text{,}\)</span> since both <span class="process-math">\(e^{t}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\cos t\)</span> are easy to differentiate and integrate, while neither becomes simpler. But since we're integrating a product, we'll try to use integration by parts anyway and hope for the best. To that end, let <span class="process-math">\(u = e^{t}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(dv = \cos t\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(du = e^{t}\,dt\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v = \sin t\text{,}\)</span> which gives</p>
