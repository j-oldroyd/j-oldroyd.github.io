<p>Computing integrals in practice often involves setting up and approximating <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/definition-riemann-sum.html" title="Definition 6.2.1: Riemann Sum">Riemann sums</a>. These sums depend on how we choose the sample points <span class="process-math">\(x_{k}^{*}\)</span> from each interval <span class="process-math">\([x_{k-1},x_{k}]\text{.}\)</span> We've mostly worked with <span class="process-math">\(x_{k}^{*} = x_{k}\text{,}\)</span> or right endpoints. We could also choose <span class="process-math">\(x_{k}^{*} = x_{k-1}\text{,}\)</span> using left endpoints. However, it's often more accurate to use <em class="emphasis">midpoints</em>: <span class="process-math">\(x_{k}^{*} = \frac{x_{k-1}+x_{k}}{2}\text{.}\)</span> The reason for this is that if we choose midpoints of intervals as our sample points, these tend to be less affected than either endpoint if the function is increasing or decreasing. In particular, we have the <dfn class="terminology">midpoint rule</dfn>.</p>
