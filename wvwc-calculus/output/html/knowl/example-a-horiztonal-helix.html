</h4> <div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{r}(t) = \dotprod{\sin\pi t, t, \cos\pi t}\text{,}\)</span> and suppose we want to sketch this function. One way to do so is to plug in values for <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> and connect the resulting points with a curve, but we can also do the following to get an idea of what this looks like. First, note that we have <span class="process-math">\(x = \sin\pi t\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z=\cos\pi t\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(x^{2}+z^{2} = 1\text{,}\)</span> which means that this looks like the unit circle in the <span class="process-math">\(xz\)</span>-plane, traced <em class="emphasis">clockwise</em>. Since we also have <span class="process-math">\(y=t\text{,}\)</span> this curve moves farther along the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis as <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> increases. If we trace this out, we get a helix (see the below plot). We can also see from the graph that it has no jumps or gaps, so <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{r}(t)\)</span> is continuous everywhere.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-vector-functions.html#example-a-horiztonal-helix" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
