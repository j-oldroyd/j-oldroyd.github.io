<p>What we want to do now is measure how much a curve "turns" at some point. First, we call a space curve <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{r}(t)\)</span> <dfn class="terminology">smooth</dfn> on some interval <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{r}^\prime(t)\neq0\)</span> for any <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(I\text{.}\)</span> Now, if we want to measure how quickly a curve is changing direction then we can use the unit tangent vector <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{T}(t)\)</span> to measure this. In particular, the derivative of the unit tangent should provide a good measure of how quickly a curve turns. However, we don't want to let the specific parametrization of the curve affect this; in other words, the rate at which a curve is turning should not depend on the speed at which the curve is traveled. This leads to the following definition.</p>
