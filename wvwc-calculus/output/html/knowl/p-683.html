<p>Part of the reason why finding the area in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/example-area-with-changing-limits.html" title="Example 8.1.3: Area with Changing Limits">ExampleÂ 8.1.3</a> was more complicated was because the curves did not represent functions of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> However, we can view each curve as representing a function of <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> namely, <span class="process-math">\(x(y) = y^{4} \quad\text{and}\quad x(y) = 2 - y^{2}.\)</span> Then the area can be found as <span class="process-math">\(\int_{-1}^{1}[(2 - y^{2}) - y^{4}]\,dy = \frac{44}{15}.\)</span> So it can be much easier if we find the area by integrating with respect to <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> as opposed to <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span></p>
