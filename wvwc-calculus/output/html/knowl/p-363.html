<div class="para">The linear approximations we came up with in <a href="section-linear-approximations.html" class="internal" title="Section 3.7: Linear Approximations">Section 3.7</a> are useful for estimating complicated functions with simpler, linear models. In essence, we use the derivative of a function to tell us how much to change a given value of the function in order to estimate that function. There is one problem with this approach, at least currently. We have good reason to suspect that our approximations are close to the exact values in certain circumstances, but we don’t know how close. The goal of this section is to derive an estimate for the derivative that can help us to find more precise approximations.</div>
