<p>If we try to plug in <span class="process-math">\(x=4\)</span> into <span class="process-math">\(\frac{x-3}{2x-8}\)</span> we get <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{0}\text{,}\)</span> which means we have run into a divide-by-zero problem. This is a good hint that the limit should be <span class="process-math">\(\pm\infty\text{,}\)</span> we just need to figure out the correct sign. There are a couple ways we can do this. First, we could set up a sign chart for this function to see where it's positive and negative and then use that to see if it's increasing or decreasing without bound as <span class="process-math">\(x\to4^{-}\text{.}\)</span> Second, we could just plug in values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> that are closer and closer to <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> and see how the function behaves. Either way, we see that it's negative for values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> that are close to (but less than) <span class="process-math">\(4\text{.}\)</span> Hence <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{x\to4^{-}}\frac{x-3}{2x-8}=-\infty\text{.}\)</span></p>
