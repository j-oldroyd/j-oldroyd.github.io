<div class="para">Up to now we have primarily considered integrals whose integrands involve functions with <em class="emphasis">elementary antiderivatives</em>. This roughly means that the antiderivative of such a function can be expressed with the “usual” functions of calculus. However, many important functions do not have elementary antiderivatives. One such example is the <em class="emphasis">Gaussian function</em> <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = e^{-x^2}\text{.}\)</span> This is one of the most important functions in mathematics and its applications, but its integral has no exact form in terms of elementary functions like sine, cosine, the logarithm, and so on. Therefore it is important to <em class="emphasis">approximate</em> such integrals with numerical methods (a process also known as <em class="emphasis">quadrature</em>).</div>
