<p>Going forward this will be our primary geometric interpretation of an antiderivative, but we need to address two issues to make the above intuition legitimate:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>What exactly <em class="emphasis">is</em> the area under a general curve <span class="process-math">\(y = f(x)\text{?}\)</span> We can find the areas of simple shapes such as rectangles, triangles and circles without issue, but we haven't even defined what the area of a more complicated region should be.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the precise relationship between antiderivatives and areas? Our intuition above suggests that antiderivatives should be related to areas, but as we saw in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-general-antiderivatives.html" title="Theorem 5.6.3: General Antiderivatives">TheoremÂ 5.6.3</a> a function can have infinitely many antiderivatives. Which one represents the area under the curve?</p></li>
</ul>
