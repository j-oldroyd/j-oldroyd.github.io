<div class="para">We've mentioned before that continuous functions are functions whose graphs can be drawn without lifting your pencil off of the page. Likewise, differentiable functions are functions whose graphs can be drawn "smoothly", without any sudden movements or cusps, and without drawing a vertical tangent line. If we think about these two concepts, we may suspect that a differentiable function is also continuous. If we can draw a graph smoothly, we certainly can't lift our pencil off the page to draw it. The next theorem makes this precise.</div>
