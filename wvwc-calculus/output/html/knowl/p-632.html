Now assume that the Earth is a sphere of radius <span class="process-math">\(R_{0}\text{,}\)</span> and that the object has enough velocity to move it a distance of <span class="process-math">\(R_{1}\)</span> units from the surface of the Earth. Then the total work done in moving the object this distance is</div>
