<div class="para">The first step to solving this IVP is to solve the ODE <span class="process-math">\(y' = x+4xy^{2}\text{.}\)</span> It may not look like it at first, but this ODE is separable since we can rewrite it as <span class="process-math">\(y' = x(1+4y^{2})\text{.}\)</span> To solve this ODE, we need to move the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> terms to the left hand side of the equation and the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> terms to the right hand side. We'll abuse notation a little bit to do so by rewriting <span class="process-math">\(y' = \dv{y}{x}\)</span> and treating <span class="process-math">\(\dv{y}{x}\)</span> as a fraction, but it won't get us into too much trouble here:</div>
