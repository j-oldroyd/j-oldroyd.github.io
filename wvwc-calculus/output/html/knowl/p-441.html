<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">At this point, it’s natural to think about what an antiderivative means geometrically since the derivative of a function has such a nice interpretation. One approach to this is to think about <dfn class="terminology">net change</dfn> of the antiderivative. Let <span class="process-math">\(F(x)\)</span> be an antiderivative of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> on some interval containing <span class="process-math">\(a,b\text{.}\)</span> The net change of <span class="process-math">\(F(x)\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(x=a\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x=b\)</span> is given by</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
F(b) - F(a).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Now, <span class="process-math">\(F^{\prime}x) = f(x)\)</span> represents instantaneous rate of change, not net change. However, if we can somehow add these instantaneous changes from <span class="process-math">\(x=a\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x=b\text{,}\)</span> they should accumulate until they give the net change of <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> Graphically, adding these instantaneous rates of change looks like it’s giving us the <em class="emphasis">area</em> under <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\text{,}\)</span> which suggests the following geometric interpretation: <em class="emphasis">the area under of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(x=a\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x=b\)</span> is just the net change of an antiderivative <span class="process-math">\(F(x)\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(x=a\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x=b\text{.}\)</span></em> Much of the next chapter is devoted to making this idea precise.</div>
