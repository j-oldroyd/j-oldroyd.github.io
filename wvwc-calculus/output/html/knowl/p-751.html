Once the mass moves past equilibrium and to the left, the force will begin acting against the motion of the mass resulting in negative work over that particular interval. The spring force itself is an example of a <dfn class="terminology">restoring force</dfn>, since it’s always trying to pull the mass back to equilibrium. To highlight this, we often write the spring force as <span class="process-math">\(F_{S} = -kx\)</span> for some positive <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span>
