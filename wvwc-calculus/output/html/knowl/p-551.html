<p>Since we need to integrate a product, and we can't easily do so with <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span>-substitution or algebra, we'll try integration by parts. We could pick <span class="process-math">\(u = 3x^{2}\text{,}\)</span> and this is certainly easy to differentiate so we can find <span class="process-math">\(du\text{.}\)</span> However, doing so leaves us with <span class="process-math">\(dv = \ln x\text{,}\)</span> which is tricky to integrate, but is easy to differentiate. So we'll try setting <span class="process-math">\(u = \ln x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(dv = 3x^{2}\,dx\text{.}\)</span> Then</p>
