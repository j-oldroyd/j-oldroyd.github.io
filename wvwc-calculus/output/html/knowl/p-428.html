<p>It's tough to think of a function whose derivative is <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\text{,}\)</span> though since the denominator is <span class="process-math">\(1+x^{2}\)</span> it seems likely that this antiderivative will involve <span class="process-math">\(\tan^{-1}x\)</span> in some way. In order to actually find the antiderivative, we'll rewrite <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> into a more convenient form. First, note that the numerator is very close to the denominator, which means we can almost cancel it out. So we'll split up the numerator as follows:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{2+x^{2}}{1+x^{2}} = \frac{1+(1+x^{2})}{1+x^{2}} = \frac{1}{1+x^{2}} + 1.
\end{equation*}
