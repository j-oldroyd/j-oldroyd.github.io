<p>Consider the function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=\frac{1}{x}\text{.}\)</span> We know from algebra that this function has a vertical asymptote at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{,}\)</span> and so in particular is undefined there. However, just because it's undefined at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> doesn't mean that we can't gather important information about the function near <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> This is because the function behaves in a very specific way as we let <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> approach <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> For example, if we let <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> approach <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> from the right, then <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> increases without bound. Similarly, <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> decreases without bound as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> approaches <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> from the left.</p>
