<p>All of the functions that we will work with will be piecewise continuous, and many important quantities in mathematics and its applications can be represented by bounded, piecewise continuous functions. Definite integrals of such quantities therefore exist and are often used as a measure of “accumulation.” In particular, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/example-finding-work-done.html" title="Example 6.1.7: Finding work done">Example 6.1.7</a> can be generalized to provide the following definition of work done by a force.</p>
