<p>There are several important things we can take away from the above example:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Much of the difficulty in computing double integrals lies in finding limits that describe the region you're integrating over. In general, it's a good idea to sketch the region you're integrating over in order to figure out what your limits should be.</p></li>
<li><p>There can be multiple ways to describe a single region. This leads to multiple ways of setting up limits for double integrals over this region. If the integrand is continuous, then <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-fubini-s-theorem.html" title="Theorem 13.1.3: Fubini's Theorem">TheoremÂ 13.1.3</a> guarantees that these different methods will all produce the same value.</p></li>
<li><p>It's important to choose limits in such a way as to make computing the double integral more manageable.</p></li>
<li><p>When finding limits for a double integral, the outermost limits <em class="emphasis">must be constant</em> since the double integral must eventually simplify to a constant. In other words, we don't really have a notion of an "indefinite" double integral.</p></li>
