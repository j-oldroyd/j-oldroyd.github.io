<div class="para">As the name suggests, any (non-vertical) line is an example of a linear function. Such functions are completely determined by the slope of the corresponding line and the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-intercept. <aside class="aside aside-like"><div class="para">Equivalently, any line is determined by knowing two distinct points on the line.</div></aside> In particular, if <span class="process-math">\(y = mx + b\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> is the slope and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-intercept. This is known as the <em class="emphasis">slope-intercept</em> equation of a line. Equations of lines are also often written in <em class="emphasis">point-slope form</em> as <span class="process-math">\(y - y_{0} = m(x - x_{0})\text{.}\)</span>
