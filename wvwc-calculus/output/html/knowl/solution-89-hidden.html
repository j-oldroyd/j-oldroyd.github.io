<p>Take downward to be the negative direction and sea level to be <span class="process-math">\(h=0\text{.}\)</span> Since acceleration is the second derivative of position, then the position (i.e. height) of the object should be the second <em class="emphasis">antiderivative</em> of acceleration. At this step, it's tempting to say that since <span class="process-math">\(h''(t) = -9.8\text{,}\)</span> we have</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
h'(t) = -9.8t\quad\text{and}\quad h(t) = -4.9 t^{2}\text{.}

<p class="continuation">And indeed, <span class="process-math">\(-4.9t^{2}\)</span> is a function whose second derivative is <span class="process-math">\(-9.8\text{.}\)</span> However, we have a slight problem here. We know that <span class="process-math">\(h(0) = 100\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(h'(0) = 0\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(h(t) = -4.9t^{2}\text{,}\)</span> then it's impossible for <span class="process-math">\(h(0)\)</span> to equal <span class="process-math">\(100\text{.}\)</span> The problem here is we forgot about the arbitrary constants.</p>
<p>To get an accurate expression for <span class="process-math">\(h(t)\text{,}\)</span> we go back to <span class="process-math">\(h''(t) = -9.8\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(h'(t) = -9.8t+C_{1}\)</span> for some constant <span class="process-math">\(C_{1}\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(h'(0) = 0\text{,}\)</span> this forces <span class="process-math">\(C_{1} = 0\text{.}\)</span> So we have <span class="process-math">\(h'(t) = -9.8t\text{.}\)</span> Now we antidifferentiate one more time to get <span class="process-math">\(h(t) = -4.9t^{2} + C_{2}\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(h(0) = 100\text{,}\)</span> this forces <span class="process-math">\(C_{2} = 100\text{.}\)</span> So</p>
