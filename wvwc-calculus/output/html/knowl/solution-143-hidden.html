<p>A good first step, as always, is to plot the region. Since <span class="process-math">\(y = 4x - x^{2}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y = 8x - 2x^{2}\)</span> give downward opening parabolas, we can quickly sketch a rough graph by finding the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-coordinates of the vertices, which occur at <span class="process-math">\(x = 2\text{.}\)</span> Finding the corresponding <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> values, and noticing that each parabola intersects the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis at <span class="process-math">\(x = 0, 4\text{,}\)</span> gives a pretty good picture of the graph.</p>
<p>If we tried to find the volume using disks/washers, we'd need to solve <span class="process-math">\(y = 4x - x^{2}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y = 8x - 2x^{2}\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> since each cross-section would be parallel to the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis. This is doable using the quadratic formula, but the algebra would get very bad very quickly once we start integrating. So we'll try shells instead.</p>
<p>A typical shell for this region has radius <span class="process-math">\(x - (-2) = x + 2\)</span> and height <span class="process-math">\((8x - 2x^{2}) - (4x - x^{2}) = 4x - x^{2}\text{.}\)</span> Hence the volume is given by</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\int_{0}^{4}2\pi(x + 2)(4x - x^{2})\,dx \amp= 4\pi\int_{0}^{2}(x + 2)(2x - x^{2})\,dx\\
\amp= 4\pi\int_{0}^{2}\left[4x - x^{3}\right]\,dx\\
\amp= 4\pi\left[2x^{2} - \frac{x^{4}}{4}\right]_{0}^{2}\\
\amp= 16\pi
\end{align*}
