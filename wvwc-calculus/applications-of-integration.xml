    <title>Areas Between Curves</title>
    <p>
      We already know that <m>\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx</m> geometrically represents the area under <m>f(x)</m> from <m>x = a</m> to <m>x = b</m>.
      Now we'd like to try to extend the integral to other geometrical concepts such as surface areas and volumes.
      An easy generalization we can make right now is that of <em>areas between curves</em>, as in <xref ref="figure-area-between-curves" text="type-global" />.

        <p>
          It may not be too much of a stretch to say that the area <m>S</m> should be given by <m>\int_{a}^{b}[f(x) - g(x)]\,dx</m>, and indeed it is, but we will prove this using Riemann sums for the reason that Riemann sums appear <em>a lot</em> in applications.
          Furthermore, Riemann sums provide us with the formula we need to evaluate integrals numerically using libraries such as NumPy.
          So let's start by partitioning the interval <m>[a,b]</m> into <m>n</m> <em>subintervals</em>
          <me>[x_{i-1},x_{i}]\quad\text{for}\quad 0\leq i\leq n,</me>
          where <m>x_{0} = a, x_{n} = b</m> and
          <me>x_{i} - x_{i-1} = \Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}.</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we'll use the subintervals to break the region <m>S</m> up into rectangles to approximate the area.
          So choose a point <m>x_{i}^{*}</m> from each subinterval <m>[x_{i-1}, x_{i}]</m> and use it to determine the height of the corresponding rectangle: <m>f(x_{i}^{*}) - g(x_{i}^{*})</m>.
          Then the area is <m>f(x_{i}^{*}) - g(x_{i}^{*})\Delta x</m>, and adding up the areas of all of the rectangles lets us approximate the area of <m>S</m>:
          <men xml:id="equation-area-between-curves-approximation">\text{area of }S \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n}[f(x_{i}^{*}) - g(x_{i}^{*})]\Delta x</men>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now send <m>n\to\infty</m> (equivalently, send <m>\Delta x\to 0</m>) to make the approximation exact:
          <m>\text{area of }S = \lim_{\Delta x\to0}\sum_{i=1}^{n}f(x_{i}^{*}) - g(x_{i}^{*})\Delta x = \int_{a}^{b}[f(x) - g(x)]\,dx.</m>

            <p>
              If we graph <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>, we see that the area will be given by <m>\int_{a}^{b}[(x^{2} + 1) - 2x^{2}]\,dx</m>, where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are the values of <m>x</m> where <m>f(x) = g(x)</m>.
              Using a bit of algebra, we get <m>a = -1</m> and <m>b = 1</m>.
              Therefore the area between the parabolas is

            To find the area between these curves, we'll need to compute <em>two</em> integrals: one for <m>0\leq x\leq 1</m> and another for <m>1\leq x\leq 2</m>.
            In particular, the area will be given by
            <m>\int_{0}^{1}[x^{\frac{1}{4}} - (-x^{\frac{1}{4}})]\,dx + \int_{1}^{2}[\sqrt{2 - x} - (-\sqrt{2 - x})]\,dx</m>.
            Doing so, we get
            <m>\frac{44}{15}</m>
            for the area between the curves.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>
      <p>
        Part of the reason why finding the area in <xref ref="example-area-with-changing-limits" text="type-global" /> was more complicated was because the curves did not represent functions of <m>x</m>.
        However, we can view each curve as representing a function of <m>y</m>, namely,
        <m>x(y) = y^{4} \quad\text{and}\quad x(y) = 2 - y^{2}.</m>
        Then the area can be found as
        <m>\int_{-1}^{1}[(2 - y^{2}) - y^{4}]\,dy = \frac{44}{15}.</m>
        So it can be much easier if we find the area by integrating with respect to <m>y</m> as opposed to <m>x</m>.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Find the area contained by the curves <m>x = y^{2} - 4y</m> and <m>x = 2y - y^{2}</m>.

          Finding the area by using integrals with respect to <m>x</m> would require setting up and solving three different integrals!
          So, not terrific.
          However, we can integrate with respect to <m>y</m> fairly easily.
          By finding where the curves intersect, we see that <m>0\leq y\leq 3</m>.
          Hence the area should be
          <md>
            <mrow>\int_{0}^{3}[(2y - y^{2}) - (y^{2} - 4y)]\,dy &amp; = \int_{0}^{3}[6y - 2y^{2}]\,dy </mrow>

            <mrow> &amp; = 27 - 18 </mrow>
          </md>
          and so the area is just <m>9</m> units.

    <title>Volumes</title>
    <p>
      Just as we can with areas, we can attempt to find volumes using integrals as well.
      At the moment we can't find volumes of general regions without first describing integrals in higher dimensions, which is the content of <xref ref="multiple-integrals" text="type-global" />.
      Until then, we'll need to restrict ourselves to so-called <term>solids of revolution</term>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, consider <xref ref="figure-solid-revolution-1" text="type-global" />.
      To generate the solid of revolution on the right, we take the graph of <m>y = f(x)</m> and rotate it about the <m>x</m>-axis, creating a three-dimensional region.

          To find the volume of such a region, the idea is to find the <em>area</em> of a general cross-section of the region, which by design should be a function of <m>x</m> alone, say <m>A(x)</m>.
          Then, roughly, <m>A(x)\Delta x</m> should represent the volume of a small cross-section of the solid, and so the integral <m>\int_{a}^{b}A(x)\,dx</m> should give us the volume of the region.
          This entire argument can be made precise using Riemann sums as in the previous section, and so we get the following: the solid <m>S</m> from <m>x = a</m> to <m>x = b</m> whose cross-sections (with respect to the <m>x</m>-axis) have area <m>A(x)</m> has volume given by
          <men xml:id="equation-solid-revolution-volume">V = \int_{a}^{b}A(x)\,dx.</men>

              To begin, let's assume that the sphere is centered at the origin.
              Then each cross section perpendicular to the <m>x</m>-axis is just a circle with radius <m>\sqrt{r^{2} - x^{2}}</m>.
              Hence each cross-sectional area is given by <m>A(x) = \pi(r^{2} - x^{2})</m>, which means the volume of the sphere should be
              <md>

          Again, the idea for finding the volumes of these regions is to determine the cross-sectional areas perpendicular to the <m>x</m>-axis (or whatever the axis of rotation happens to be) and then integrate.

              As is almost always the case, a good way to start is by graphing the region to get a rough idea of what it looks like.
              Doing so, we see that each of the cross-sections are circles.
              But this is to be expected, since the region is a solid of revolution.
              Given <m>x</m> between <m>1</m> and <m>4</m>, the area of the corresponding cross-section is given by
              <me>A(x) = \pi(2 - \sqrt{x})^{2}.</me>
              Hence the volume of this region should be
              <md>
                <mrow>\int_{1}^{4}\pi(2 - \sqrt{x})^{2}\,dx \amp= \pi\int_{1}^{4}(2 - 4\sqrt{x} + x)\,dx</mrow>
                <mrow> \amp= \pi\left[2x - \frac{8}{3}x^{\frac{3}{2}} + \frac{x^{2}}{2}\right]_{1}^{4}</mrow>
                <mrow> \amp= \pi\left[\left(8 - \frac{64}{3} + 8\right) - \left(2 - \frac{8}{3} + \frac{1}{2}\right)\right]</mrow>

          The previous problems involved finding volumes by using disks since disks were natural cross-sections.
          The next example instead uses washers as cross-sections instead.
          Although the formula we get for the volume is slightly different, it's still essentially integrating the areas of the cross-sections.

                Since the axis of rotation is <m>x = 2</m>, we want to look at cross-sections perpendicular to this line, i.e., parallel to the <m>x</m>-axis.
                Each such cross-section will look like a washer, and hence its area will involve the inner radius and outer radius of the washer.
                Since the radii are measured in terms of horizontal distance, we'll need to find <m>x</m> in terms of <m>y</m>.
                Doing so, we see that the inner radius is given by <m>2 - y</m> while the outer radius is given by <m>2 - y^{2}</m>.
                Therefore the volume of the region is given by

          <title>Volumes by Cylindrical Shells</title>
          <p>
            The method we used to find volumes in <xref ref="section-volumes" text="type-global" /> applies to solids that have cross-sections depending on <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> alone.
            Once we had a formula for this area, we could then integrate it to get the volume.
            However, not all shapes have such simple cross-sections, and so this method doesn't apply in general.
            In this section, we'll look at using cylindrical shells instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, the following fact will prove useful: the volume of a cylindrical shell of height <m>h</m>, inner radius <m>r_{1}</m> and outer radius <m>r_{2}</m> is given by
            <men xml:id="equation-volume-cylindrical-shell"> V = 2\pi\frac{r_{1} + r_{2}}{2}h(r_{2} - r_{1}) = 2\pi rh\Delta r</men>
            where <m>r</m> is the "average radius" and <m>\Delta r</m> is the thickness of the shell.
            If we can break a solid up into these cylindrical "cross-sections," then integrating these areas should again give us the volume of the solid.
            For shells that are perpendicular to the <m>x</m>-axis, we can typically replace <m>r</m> with <m>x</m> and <m>h</m> with <m>f(x)</m>, leading to an integral of the form
            <me>\int_{a}^{b}2\pi xf(x)\,dx.</me>
            <aside>
              <p>
                Finding areas using disks and washers usually involves finding disks/washers that are perpendicular to the axis of rotation.
                When finding volumes using shells, we'll typically use shells that are <em>parallel</em> to the axis of rotation.

          </p>
          <p>
            One final note: this method, as in <xref ref="section-volumes" text="type-global" />, applies only to solids with a certain degree of symmetry.
            If you continue on to Calculus 3, the techniques you'll learn in <xref ref="multiple-integrals" text="type-global" /> will replace this method as they do the disk and washer methods from <xref ref="section-volumes" text="type-global" />.
            In particular, this method is a special case of the transformation to <em>cylindrical coordinates</em> presented in <xref ref="section-cylindrical-coordinates" text="type-global" />.

                  Find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by <m>y = x^{2}</m>, <m>y = 0</m> and <m>x = 1</m> about the <m>y</m>-axis.

                <p>
                  The axis of rotation is the <m>y</m>-axis, so each shell should be perpendicular to this axis as well.
                  Drawing a typical shell, we see that the radius at <m>x</m> should be <m>x</m> while the height is <m>f(x) = x^{2}</m>.
                  So the volume of this region should be
                  <me>\int_{0}^{1}2\pi x(x^{2})\,dx = \frac{\pi}{2}.</me>

            It should be noted that the volume in <xref ref="example-finding-volumes-using-cylindrical-shells" text="type-global" /> could also have been found using washers instead of shells.
            If you can, you should use disks or washers before using shells, since integrals derived from using shells are typically more complicated.

                Find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region bounded by <m>x = 0</m>, <m>y = 4x - x^{2}</m> and <m>y = 8x - 2x^{2}</m> about the line <m>x = -2</m>.

            <solution>
              <p>
                A good first step, as always, is to plot the region.
                Since <m>y = 4x - x^{2}</m> and <m>y = 8x - 2x^{2}</m> give downward opening parabolas, we can quickly sketch a rough graph by finding the <m>x</m>-coordinates of the vertices, which occur at <m>x = 2</m>.
                Finding the corresponding <m>y</m> values, and noticing that each parabola intersects the <m>x</m>-axis at <m>x = 0, 4</m>, gives a pretty good picture of the graph.
              </p>
              <p>
                If we tried to find the volume using disks/washers, we'd need to solve <m>y = 4x - x^{2}</m> and <m>y = 8x - 2x^{2}</m> for <m>x</m> since each cross-section would be parallel to the <m>x</m>-axis.
                This is doable using the quadratic formula, but the algebra would get very bad very quickly once we start integrating.
                So we'll try shells instead.
              </p>
              <p>
                A typical shell for this region has radius <m>x - (-2) = x + 2</m> and height <m>(8x - 2x^{2}) - (4x - x^{2}) = 4x - x^{2}</m>.
                Hence the volume is given by
