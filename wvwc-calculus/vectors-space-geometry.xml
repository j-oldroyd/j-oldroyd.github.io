    <title>Vectors and Euclidean Space</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>Our main goal now is to extend the concepts of calculus into multiple dimensions. We start by considering the three-dimensional space <m>\RR^{3}</m>.</p>
    </introduction>

            <title><m>xyz</m>-coordinates</title>
            <p>
                We're used to Cartesian coordinates in the plane: each point in the plane can be represented by an <m>x</m>-coordinate and a <m>y</m>-coordinate.
                This representation is determined by the <term>coordinate axes</term> (the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes).
                There's nothing preventing us from doing the same for three dimensions.
                We'll just need three coordinate axes: the <m>x</m>-, <m>y</m>- and <m>z</m>-axes.
                We typically view the <m>xy</m>-plane as horizontal, and the <m>z</m>-axis as vertical, but there's no mathematical preference either way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just as the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes determined the <m>xy</m>-plane, we can also get the <m>xz</m>- and <m>yz</m>-planes.
                These planes divide space into eight <term>octants</term>.
                And just as any point in the <m>xy</m>-plane can be represented by measuring along the <m>x</m>-axis and <m>y</m>-axis to get a point <m>(x,y)</m>, we can do the same in space to get a point <m>(x,y,z)</m>.
                The set of all points like this is denoted by <m>\RR^{3}</m>, and is the <term>three-dimensional coordinate system</term>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given any point <m>(a,b,c)</m> in <m>\RR^{3}</m>, we can find its <term>projections</term> onto any of the coordinate axes or coordinate planes without too much trouble.
                The projection onto a line or plane is the point on that line or plane that is closest to the original point <m>(a,b,c)</m>.

                        Here's how we can find the projection of the point <m>(-1,3,4)</m> onto the <m>yz</m>-plane.
                        Note that the <m>yz</m>-plane is just the set of all points with <m>x</m>-coordinate equation to <m>0</m>, so the projection of <m>(-1,3,4)</m> onto the <m>yz</m>-plane is the point <m>(0,3,4)</m>.

                        Then the surface in <m>\RR^{3}</m> represented by <m>x+y=2</m> is actually the surface consisting of all points directly above and directly below the line <m>y=2-x</m> in the <m>xy</m>-plane.

                        So the intersection of this sphere with the <m>xz</m>-plane traces out the curve <m>(x+2)^{2} + (0-3)^{2} + z^{2} = 9</m> in the <m>xz</m>-plane, which is just the point <m>(-2,0,0)</m>.

            <p>
                One of our goals in this chapter is to adequately describe motion in space.
                A useful way to do this uses the concept of <term>vector</term>, which we think of as a quantity that has both direction and magnitude/length.
                A simple example would be velocity: velocity in space has a direction and also a magnitude (speed).
                We will typically denote vectors by using boldface letters such as <m>\vv{x}</m> or letters with a bar overhead such as <m>\bar{x}</m>.
                We represent vectors as arrows with an <term>initial point</term> and a <term>terminal point</term>:

            <p>
                Although it isn't too hard to add and scale vectors visually, it'll be beneficial to do the same algebraically.
                We can do so by breaking a vector down into its <term>components</term>. Consider a vector in <m>\vv{x}</m> in <m>\RR^{2}</m>, and suppose if we move it to the origin then the tip of the vector is at the point <m>(3,-1)</m>.
                Then the components of <m>\vv{x}</m> are <m>3</m> and <m>-1</m>, and we write
                <me>\vv{x} = \dotprod{3,-1}.</me>
            </p>
            <p>
                Note the use of brackets here, since technically we are saying that the vector <m>\vv{x}</m> is distinct from the point <m>(3,-1)</m>, even though they are closely related.
                We say that the <term>position vector</term> of a point is the vector whose components are the same as the coordinates of the point.
                Geometrically, the position vector of a point <m>P</m> is the vector with its tail at the origin and its tip at <m>P</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                So any vector in <m>\RR^{2}</m> can be represented using components by <m>\vv{x} = \dotprod{x_{1},x_{2}}</m>.
                Similarly, any vector in <m>\RR^{3}</m> can be represented as <m>\vv{x} = \dotprod{x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}}</m>.
                Once you represent a vector in component form, addition and scalar multiplication is straightforward.

                Finding magnitudes of vectors can also be done by applying the distance formula from <xref ref="section-coordinates-in-3-space" text="type-global" /> to the components of the vectors.
                The magnitude of a vector <m>\vv{x}</m> is denoted by <m>|\vv{x}|</m> or <m>\|\vv{x}\|</m>.
                For example, the magnitude of <m>\vv{b}-3\vv{a}</m> from the previous example is
                <me>\|\vv{b}-3\vv{a}\| = \sqrt{36+1+64} = \sqrt{101}.</me>

                Suppose we're given two vectors. What we'd like to do is to come up with a measure of how much these vectors overlap.
                Such a measure may be useful for determining if forces are too close together, for example.
                So consider two vectors <m>\vv{x} = \dotprod{x_{1},y_{1},z_{1}}</m> and <m>\vv{y} = \dotprod{x_{2},y_{2},z_{2}}</m> as in the following diagram.

                The dot product, and in particular <xref ref="theorem-geometry-of-the-dot-product" text="type-global" />, gives us a good way to tell if two vectors are perpendicular.
                However, it says nothing about how to <em>construct</em> perpendicular vectors.

            <p>So the cross product always produces orthogonal vectors.

Then <m>\vv{a}\times\vv{b}</m> is parallel to your thumb.</p>
            <p>We would also like to know the magnitude of the cross product. We can just compute it using <xref ref="definition-the-cross-product" text="type-global" /> and find the magnitude using our usual formula. If we do so, we obtain (after a lot of simplifying!)</p>

            </example>

            <p>Another important property of the magnitude of the cross product is the following: <m>|\vv{a}\times\vv{b}|</m> is exactly equal to the area of the parallelogram determined by <m>\vv{a}</m> and <m>\vv{b}</m>.</p>

The torque is greater if the force is applied at a direction perpendicular (or nearly so) to that of the wrench, and smaller if the force is nearly parallel to the direction of the wrench. As a quick check, the torque is <m>\vv{0}</m> if the force is exactly parallel to the direction of the wrench, which makes sense: if we're pushing or pulling the wrench, the bolt won't rotate at all.</p>

                <p>where <m>\vv{r}</m> is the vector from the screw to the point where the force <m>\vv{F}</m> is applied. We can find <m>\vv{r}</m> without too much trouble: it's <m>\vv{r} = \dotprod{.027,.154,0}</m>. To find the force <m>\vv{F}</m>, note that it's perpendicular to both the long arm and short arm of the screw. So a starting guess would be</p>
                <me>\vv{F} = \dotprod{.027,0,0}\times\dotprod{0,.154,0} = \dotprod{0,0,.042}.</me>
                <p>Such a force would turn the screw clockwise, but it has the wrong magnitude. So we need to adjust it a bit: <m>\vv{F} = \dotprod{0,0,.5}</m>. So the torque is given by</p>

        <introduction>
            <p>
                Recall that the equation of a line in <m>\RR^{2}</m> has the general form <m>ax+by + c = 0</m>.
                However, this equation does not give a line in <m>\RR^{3}</m>.
                In fact, it actually gives a plane, as we'll see! What we want to do now is find exactly how to describe a given line or plane.

                <title>Equation of a line with a given direction and point</title>
                <p>Suppose we want to find the equation of a line <m>L</m> that passes through <m>(2,5,-3)</m> and is perpendicular to <m>\vv{u} = \dotprod{2,1,2}</m>. <xref ref="theorem-parametric-equations-of-a-line" text="type-global" /> says that we only need to find the right choices for <m>\vv{r}_{0}</m> and <m>\vv{v}</m> in order to get the equation of such a line, and we can write down one of these right away:</p>
                <me>\vv{r}_{0} = \dotprod{2,5,-3}.</me>
                <p>So we just need to find <m>\vv{v}</m>. Since <m>L</m> is orthogonal to <m>\vv{u} = \dotprod{2,1,2}</m>, this means we want <m>\vv{v}</m> to be orthogonal to <m>\vv{u}</m> as well. A great way to find such a <m>\vv{v}</m> is to use the cross product. If <m>\vv{w}</m> is any nonzero vector, then <m>\vv{u}\times\vv{w}</m> must be orthogonal to both <m>\vv{u}</m> and <m>\vv{w}</m>, and in particular it must be orthogonal to <m>\vv{u}</m>. So we can take</p>
                <me>\vv{v} = \dotprod{2,1,2}\times\vv{i} = \dotprod{0,2,-1}.</me>
                <p>So the equation of this line is</p>
                <me>\vv{r} = \dotprod{2,1+2t,2-t}</me>
                <p>As <m>t</m> varies, this will trace out our line.</p>
            </example>
            <p>When we begin working with line integrals, we'll need to know how to parameterize a line segment, so we'll discuss that now. Suppose we have a line segment between two points <m>P_{0}</m> and <m>P_{1}</m>. Let <m>\vv{r}_{0}</m> and <m>\vv{r}_{1}</m> denote the corresponding position vectors of these points (i.e. the vectors whose components are given by the coordinates of these points). Then the equation of the <em>line</em> between <m>P_{0}</m> and <m>P_{1}</m> is given by</p>
            <me>\vv{r}] = \vv{r}_{0}+t(\vv{r}_{1}-\vv{r}_{0}) = (1-t)\vv{r}_{0}+t\vv{r}_{1}.</me>
            <p>To get the line segment we're actually looking for, we just need to restrict <m>t</m> to the interval <m>0\leq t\leq 1</m>. So we can say that </p>
            <me>\vv{r} = (1-t)\vv{r}_{0}+t\vv{r}_{1} \quad\text{with}\quad0\leq t\leq 1</me>
            <p>traces out the line segment between <m>P_{0}</m> and <m>P_{1}</m>.</p>

        <subsection xml:id="subsection-equations-of-planes">
            <title>Equations of Planes</title>
            <p>Now we move on to finding the equation of a plane. We'll try a vector approach to this like we did for lines, and this won't be too bad to do. We just need to keep the following in mind:</p>
            <observation xml:id="observation-vectors-and-planes">
                <p>A plane in <m>\RR^{3}</m> is uniquely determined by specifying a single point for it to pass through and a direction for it to face.</p>
            </observation>
            <p>So in particular, vectors will provide a nice way to specify the direction of a plane, and any vector that does so must be orthogonal to the plane. If a (nonzero) vector <m>\vv{n}</m> is orthogonal to a given plane, then we call <m>\vv{n}</m> a <term>normal vector</term> to the plane. Now we can build up an equation of a given plane.</p>
            <p>Let <m>P_{0}(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})</m> denote a point on the plane, and let <m>\vv{n} = \dotprod{a,b,c}</m> be a normal vector to the plane. If <m>\vv{r}=\dotprod{x,y,z}</m> is the position vector of any other point on the plane, then it must be true that <m>\vv{n}\cdot(\vv{r}-\vv{r}_{0}) = 0</m>, where <m>\vv{r}_{0}</m> is the position vector of <m>P_{0}</m>. We can summarize this in the following theorem.</p>

                <p>We want to find the equation of the plane that contains the intersection of these two lines and is orthogonal to the first line. By <xref ref="theorem-vector-and-scalar-equations-of-a-plane" text="type-global" />, we need a point on the plane and a normal vector. Since the plane must contain the intersection of these two lines, that's our point. To find it, we'll set <m>\vv{r}_{1} = \vv{r}_{2}</m> and go from there:</p>
                <md>
                    <mrow>\vv{r}_{1}=\vv{r}_{2} &amp; \Rightarrow \dotprod{-1,1,-2} + \dotprod{t+s,s-t,2t} = \vv{0} </mrow>
                    <mrow> &amp; \Rightarrow t+s-1 = s-t+1 = 2t-2 = 0 </mrow>
                    <mrow> &amp; \Rightarrow t = 1\quad\text{and}\quad s=0 </mrow>
                </md>
                <p>So the position vector <m>\vv{r}_{0}</m> of the point where these lines intersect is given by <m>\vv{r}_{0} = \dotprod{2,0,2}</m>. We also need a normal vector to the plane, but this is easy to find: since the plane needs to be orthogonal to the first line, we can just take <m>\vv{n} = \dotprod{1,-1,2}</m>. So the equation of our plane is</p>

        <title>Vector Functions</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>
                Recall from <xref ref="subsection-equations-of-lines" text="type-global" /> that the equation of a line can be written as
                <me>\vv{r} = \vv{r}_{0}+t\vv{v} = \dotprod{x_{0}+at, y_{0}+bt, z_{0}+ct}.</me>
                This is our first example of a <term>vector function</term>. Vector functions are functions of the form
                <me>\vv{r}(t) = \dotprod{f(t),g(t),h(t)},</me>
                and graphs of vector functions are called <term>space curves</term>.
                We call <m>f,g,h</m> the <term>component functions</term> of <m>\vv{r}</m>.
                We're interested in how these curves change, which means we're interested in how to do calculus on space curves.
                Although these curves live in <m>\RR^{3}</m>, there's still only one independent variable: <m>t</m>.
                So much of what we learned in Calculus I applies to space curves.
            </p>
        </introduction>
        <subsection xml:id="limits-with-space-curves">
            <title>Limits with Space Curves</title>
            <p>We can take limits with vector functions just as we can with regular functions.</p>

            <p>In other words, if you want to take the limit of a vector function you can just take the limits of the component functions.</p>
            <example xml:id="example-limit-of-a-vector-function">
                <title>Limit of a vector function</title>
                <p>Let</p>
                <me>\vv{r}(t) = \frac{t^{2}-1}{t-1}\vv{i} + \sqrt{t+8}\vv{j} - \frac{\sin\pi t}{\ln t}\vv{k}.</me>
                <p>Suppose we want to find <m>\lim_{t\to 1}\vv{r}(t)</m>. Then we just need to take the limit of each component. So</p>

            </example>
            <p>
                Just as in Calculus I, we say that a vector function <m>\vv{r}(t)</m> is <term>continuous</term> at <m>t=a</m> if <m>\lim_{t\to a}\vv{r}(t) = \vv{r}(a)</m>.
                In general, a vector function is continuous wherever <em>all</em> of its components functions are continuous.

                <p>Let <m>\vv{r}(t) = \dotprod{\sin\pi t, t, \cos\pi t}</m>, and suppose we want to sketch this function. One way to do so is to plug in values for <m>t</m> and connect the resulting points with a curve, but we can also do the following to get an idea of what this looks like. First, note that we have <m>x = \sin\pi t</m> and <m>z=\cos\pi t</m>. So <m>x^{2}+z^{2} = 1</m>, which means that this looks like the unit circle in the <m>xz</m>-plane, traced <em>clockwise</em>. Since we also have <m>y=t</m>, this curve moves farther along the <m>y</m>-axis as <m>t</m> increases. If we trace this out, we get a helix (see the below plot). We can also see from the graph that it has no jumps or gaps, so <m>\vv{r}(t)</m> is continuous everywhere.</p>

            <p>Suppose some particle travels along the space curve given by <m>\vv{r}(t)</m> for <m>a\leq t\leq b</m>. What we'd like to do is determine how far the particle travels over this time interval. Recall that distance is just speed multiplied by time, and the speed of this particle is given by <m>|\vv{r}'(t)|</m>. So we can imagine that the distance traveled by this particle over some infinitesimal time interval <m>dt</m> to be given by <m>|\vv{r}'(t)|\,dt</m>. So adding up all of these distances from <m>t=a</m> to <m>t=b</m> should give us the arc length. This suggests (but does not prove!) the following formula for arc length:</p>
            <men xml:id="equation-arc-length-formula">L = \int_{a}^{b}|\vv{r}'(t)|\,dt.</men>
            <p><xref ref="equation-arc-length-formula" text="type-global" /> gives the length <m>L</m> of the space curve <m>\vv{r}(t)</m> from <m>t=a</m> to <m>t=b</m>, assuming that the integral exists.</p>

            </example>
            <p>One thing we'd like to do now is to parametrize a space curve <m>\vv{r}(t)</m> with respect to arc length. Here's what we mean by this: given some <m>\vv{r}(t)</m> with <m>a\leq t\leq b</m>, we define its <term>arc length function</term> <m>s(t)</m> by</p>
            <me>s(t) = \int_{a}^{t}|\vv{r}'(u)|\,du.</me>
            <p>If we can then solve for <m>t</m> in terms of <m>s</m>, this parametrizes the curve <m>\vv{r}(t)</m> in terms of the arc length variable <m>s</m>.</p>

        <title>Motion in Space</title>
        <p>We now move on to examining motion in <m>\RR^{3}</m>. First, recall that <m>\vv{r}(t)</m> represents the position vector of some particle moving along a curve in space, then its velocity <m>\vv{t}(t)</m> and acceleration <m>\vv{a}(t)</m> are given by</p>

            <title>Motion of a projectile</title>
            <statement>
                <p>A projectile is fired out of a cannon with an initial speed of <quantity><mag>200</mag><unit base="meter"/><per base="second"/></quantity> to the west and with an angle of elevation of <m>30^{\circ}</m>. If the particle was fired from a raised platform that is <quantity><mag>50</mag><unit base="meter"/></quantity> off level ground, where does the particle land?</p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>First, we'll assume that <m>\vv{j}</m> points northward and <m>\vv{k}</m> points straight up. Let's assume that the platform is directly above the origin. If we let <m>\vv{r}(t)</m> denote the position (in meters) of the particle at time <m>t</m> (in seconds), then we can say that <m>\vv{r}_{0} = \vv{r}(0) = \dotprod{0,0,50}</m>. We also have</p>

                </md>
                <p>We can integrate up to find the position <m>\vv{r}(t)</m>:</p>
                <me>\vv{v}(t) = -9.8t\vv{k}+\vv{C}</me>
                <p>where <m>\vv{C}</m> is an arbitrary constant vector. To find it, we'll use our initial condition on <m>\vv{v}</m>:</p>
                <me>\vv{v}(0) = \vv{C} = -100\sqrt{3}\vv{i}+100\vv{k}.</me>
                <p>So <m>\vv{v}(t) = -9.8t\vv{k}-100\sqrt{3}\vv{i}+100\vv{k}</m>. Integrating once more to get the position, we have</p>
                <me>\vv{r}(t) = -100\sqrt{3}t\vv{i}+(100t-4.9t^{2})\vv{k} + \vv{D} = -100\sqrt{3}t\vv{i} + (100t-4.9t^{2})\vv{k} + 50\vv{k}</me>.
                <p>So <m>\vv{r}(t) = \dotprod{-100\sqrt{3}t, 0, 50 + 100t - 4.9t^{2}}</m>.</p>
                <p>To find where the particle lands, we just set the third component equal to zero and solve for <m>t</m> to get</p>
                <me>t = \frac{-100\pm\sqrt{10000+980}}{-9.8} = -.4883,20.896.</me>
                <p>We need to choose the positive value for <m>t</m>, and if we do so we see that when the projectile hits ground it's at position <m>\vv{r}(20.896) = \dotprod{-3619.38,0,0}.</m> So the projectile is a little over <quantity><mag>3.5</mag><unit base="meter" prefix="kilo"/></quantity> to the west.</p>

        <p><m>a_{T}</m> represents how much of the acceleration is directed tangent to the curve <m>\vv{r}(t)</m>, whereas <m>a_{N}</m> represents how much of the acceleration is directed perpendicular to the tangent.</p>

                <p>Since <m>\vv{a} = -9.8\vv{k}</m>, the tangential component should be greatest when the projectile is fired or when it hits the ground, since these are the points where the direction of the trajectory most closely matches the direction of acceleration.
