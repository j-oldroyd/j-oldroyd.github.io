    <introduction>
        <p>
            If a function is differentiable, then its derivative gives us information about how that function is changing.
            This information is important in many different applications of calculus.

            In general, local extrema and absolute extrema can be different.
            However, the following theorem does provide a relationship between the two on <em>closed, bounded</em> intervals.
        </p>
        <theorem xml:id="theorem-extreme-value-theorem">
            <title>Extreme Value Theorem</title>
            <idx>Extreme Value Theorem</idx>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Let <m>f(x)</m> be a continuous function defined on the interval <m>[a,b]</m>
                    Then <m>f(x)</m> has both an absolute maximum and absolute minimum on <m>[a,b]</m>.
                    Furthermore, these values occur at either an endpoint or a local extrema.
                </p>
            </statement>
        </theorem>
        <p>
            What <xref ref="theorem-extreme-value-theorem" text="type-global" /> tells us is that we can find the extreme values of any continuous function defined on a closed, bounded interval by just checking the function at the endpoint and at its local extrema.
        </p>
        <example xml:id="example-finding-extreme-values">
            <title>Finding extreme values</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Let <m>f(x) = (x^{2}-1)^{2}</m>.
                    Given that <m>f</m> has local extrema at <m>x=-1,0,1</m>, find the extreme values of <m>f</m> on the interval <m>[\frac{1}{2},6]</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    <xref ref="theorem-extreme-value-theorem" text="type-global" /> tells us that we can find the extreme values by checking local extrema and the endpoints of our interval.
                    Since <m>x=1</m> is the only local extreme value inside of our interval, that's the only one we need to check.
                    We have
                    <me>f(\frac{1}{2}) = \frac{9}{16}, f(1) = 0\quad\text{and}\quad f(6) = 35^{2}.</me>
                    So the absolute minimum of <m>f</m> on <m>[\frac{1}{2},6]</m> is <m>0</m> and the absolute maximum is <m>35^{2}.</m>
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>
        <p>
            So if we can find where a function has local extrema, then finding absolute extrema won't be too much more difficult.
            Thankfully, this is relatively straightforward if the function is differentiable.
        </p>
        <theorem xml:id="theorem-fermat-s-theorem">
            <title>Fermat's Theorem</title>
            <idx>Fermat's Theorem</idx>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Let <m>f(x)</m> be a function and let <m>c</m> be a local extreme value of <m>f</m>.
                    If <m>f'(c)</m> exists, then <m>f'(c) = 0</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
        </theorem>
        <p>
            So finding local extrema of <m>f(x)</m> often amounts to finding where <m>f'(x) = 0</m>, i.e., where it has a root.
            However, we also need to worry about where <m>f'(x)</m> doesn't exist (just think about <m>y = |x|</m>).
            This leads to the following definition.
        </p>
        <definition xml:id="definition-critical-points">

            <statement>
                <p>
                    Let <m>f(x)</m> be a differentiable function.
                    The <term>critical points</term> of <m>f(x)</m> are the points where <m>f'(x) = 0</m> or <m>f'(x)</m> does not exist.
                </p>
            </statement>
        </definition>
        <p>
            Our method for finding extreme values on a closed interval will proceed as follows: find all the critical points, and then compare the values of our function at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval.

                    Find the extreme values of <m>f</m> on the interval <m>[-\frac{\pi}{3},\frac{\pi}{3}]</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    We need to find the critical points first.
                    We have
                    <me>f'(\theta) = \frac{4}{3} - \sec^{2}\theta.</me>
                    This is <m>0</m> if <m>\cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}</m>, which occurs in our interval only if <m>\theta = \pm\frac{\pi}{6}</m>.
                    So we need to check <m>f</m> at <m>\pm\frac{\pi}{3},\pm\frac{\pi}{6}</m>.

                <p>
                    First, find the critical points of <m>g</m>:
                    <me>g'(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^{-\frac{2}{3}} - \frac{4}{3}x^{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{1}{3}x^{-\frac{2}{3}}(1 - 4x).</me>
                    This is <m>0</m> at <m>x = \frac{1}{4}</m> and undefined at <m>0</m>, so our critical points are <m>x=0,\frac{1}{4}</m>.
                    So to find the absolute extrema we need to check <m>g</m> at <m>x=-1,0,\frac{1}{4},1</m>.
                    Doing so, we see that the absolute minimum value is <m>-2</m> at <m>x=-1</m> and the absolute maximum is <m>(\frac{1}{4})^{1/3} - (\frac{1}{4})^{4/3}</m> at <m>x = \frac{1}{4}</m>.

        <title>The Mean Value Theorem</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>
                The linear approximations we came up with in <xref ref="section-linear-approximations" text="type-global" /> are useful for estimating complicated functions with simpler, linear models.
                In essence, we use the derivative of a function to tell us how much to change a given value of the function in order to estimate that function.
                There is one problem with this approach, at least currently.
                We have good reason to suspect that our approximations are close to the exact values in certain circumstances, but we don't know how close.
                The goal of this section is to derive an estimate for the derivative that can help us to find more precise approximations.

                We start with a theorem that is very reasonable, at least geometrically.

                Then this means the graph of <m>f</m> must "turn around" at some point in <m>[a,b]</m>, i.e., there is a local maximum or minimum contained within the interval.
                Combining this observation with <xref ref="theorem-fermat-s-theorem" text="type-global" /> gives us <term>Rolle's Theorem.</term>

            <title>The Mean Value Theorem</title>
            <p>
                <xref ref="theorem-rolle-s-theorem" text="title" /> is powerful because it has very general conditions for its use.
                However, it does require the function in question to take on the same values at the endpoints of <m>[a,b]</m>, and this is a condition we'd like to try to relax.
                However, we'll try to be clever about this and use <xref ref="theorem-rolle-s-theorem" text="title" />
                to do most of the heavy lifting for us.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we imagine graphing some differentiable function <m>f(x)</m> on some interval <m>[a,b]</m>, but <m>f(a)\neq f(b)</m>, then we can't apply <xref ref="theorem-rolle-s-theorem" text="title" />.
                But maybe we can adjust it just a little bit so that we can?
                In particular, the only reason we can't use <xref ref="theorem-rolle-s-theorem" text="type-global" /> is that <m>f(a)\neq f(b)</m>.
                But if we subtract the line through these points from <m>f(x)</m>, we should get a new function for which <xref ref="theorem-rolle-s-theorem" text="type-global" /> applies.
            </p>
            <p>
                The line through these points has equation
                <me>y = f(a) + \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}(x-a).</me>
                So define
                <me>g(x) = f(x) - y = f(x) - f(a) - \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}(x-a).</me>
                Then
                <me>g(a) = g(b) = 0,</me>
                So <xref ref="theorem-rolle-s-theorem" text="type-global" /> <em>does</em> apply to this function.
                Hence there exists some number <m>c</m> between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> for which <m>g'(c) = 0</m>.
            </p>
            <p>

                The <xref ref="theorem-mean-value-theorem" text="title" /> essentially says that there is at least one point inside of <m>(a,b)</m> for which the slope <m>f'(c)</m> at that point matches the "average slope" <m>\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}.</m>
                Like <xref ref="theorem-rolle-s-theorem" text="title" />, this is an existence theorem.
                However, it's slightly more general, and so is applicable in more situations.
                It's also useful in deriving error estimates.

                        Let <m>f(x) = \sqrt{x}</m> and let <m>L(x)</m> denote the linear approximation to <m>f(x)</m> at <m>a=9</m>.

                    <p>
                        First, we should find <m>L(x)</m>, which from <xref ref="section-linear-approximations" text="type-global" /> is just
                        <me>L(x) = 3 + \frac{1}{6}(x-9).</me>
                        The error we need to estimate is <m>|f(x) - L(x)|</m>, for <m>x</m> in <m>[9,16]</m>.
                        So we'll set <m>g(x) = f(x) - L(x)</m> and let <m>x</m> be some number in <m>[9,16]</m>.
                        By <xref ref="theorem-mean-value-theorem" text="type-global" />, there exists some number <m>c</m> in <m>(9,x)</m> such that
                        <me>g(x) - g(9) = g'(c)(x-9).</me>
                        Now, <m>g(9) = 0</m> and <m>g'(c) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{c}} - \frac{1}{6}</m>.
                        So the above equation becomes
                        <me>f(x) - L(x) = \left(\frac{1}{2\sqrt{c}} - \frac{1}{6}\right)(x-9).</me>

                    <p>
                        Now, we don't know anything about <m>c</m> aside from the fact that it lives in <m>(9,16)</m>.
                        However, we do have an expression for <m>|f(x) - L(x)|</m> now:
                        <md>
                            <mrow>|f(x) - L(x)| &amp; = \left|\left(\frac{1}{2\sqrt{c}} - \frac{1}{6}\right)(x-9)\right|</mrow>

                        </md>
                        So if <m>x</m> is in <m>[9,16]</m>, then the error <m>|f(x) - L(x)|</m> is <em>at most</em> <m>\frac{7}{24}</m>.
                        In other words,
                        <me>L(x) - \frac{7}{24} \leq f(x) \leq L(x) + \frac{7}{24}.</me>

                    <p>
                        The idea of the proof is to use <xref ref="theorem-mean-value-theorem" text="type-global" /> to show that <m>f(x_{2}) - f(x_{1}) = 0</m> for any points <m>x_{1},x_{2}</m> in <m>(a,b)</m>.

                        However, <m>f'(c) = 0</m> by assumption, and so <m>f(x_{2}) - f(x_{1}) = 0</m>.
                        In other words, <m>f(x_{2}) = f(x_{1})</m>.
                        Hence <m>f</m> must be constant.

            Recall that if <m>f(x)</m> is a function and <m>f'(x)</m> exists, then <m>f'(c) &gt; 0</m> for some <m>c</m> means that <m>f</m> is increasing at <m>c</m>, while <m>f'(c) &lt; 0</m> means that <m>f</m> is decreasing at <m>c</m>.
            Now, suppose that <m>c</m> is a critical point of <m>f(x)</m>.
            Then <m>f'(c) = 0</m>.
            If <m>f'</m> changes sign from negative to positive, then <m>f'(c)</m> is a local minimum.
            Conversely, if <m>f'</m> changes sign from positive to negative, then <m>f'(c)</m> is a local maximum.
            This is the <term>first derivative test</term>.

                <p>
                    We can answer all of these questions by setting up a sign chart for
                    <me>f'(x) = x^{3}e^{-x}(4-x)</me>.
                    The critical points are <m>x=0,4</m>, and <m>f' &lt; 0</m> on <m>(-\infty,0)\cup(4,\infty)</m> and <m>f' &gt; 0</m> on <m>(0,4)</m>.
                    So <m>f</m> is decreasing on the first set of intervals, increasing on <m>(0,4)</m>, <m>f</m> has a local maximum at <m>x=4</m> and a local minimum at <m>x=0</m>.

                <p>
                    We need to find the critical points, which means we need to find <m>G'(x)</m>:
                    <me>G'(x) = \frac{(x-1)(2x) - x^{2}}{(x-1)^{2}} = \frac{x(x-2)}{(x-1)^{2}}.</me>
                    So the critical points are <m>x=0,1,2</m>.
                    Note that <m>x=1</m> <em>cannot</em> be a local extreme value of <m>G</m> since it's not in the domain of <m>G</m>.
                    However, we still need to include it in our sign chart.
                    If we do so, we find that <m>G</m> has a local minimum at <m>x=2</m> and a local maximum at <m>x=0</m> by the first derivative test.

        <p>
            One benefit of the first derivative test is that we only need to compute first derivatives to use it.
            However, if a function has a second derivative, then it's often easier to use the concavity of the graph at a critical point to determine whether a critical point is a local maximum or minimum.
            In particular, if <m>f(x)</m> is a function and <m>f''(x)</m> is continuous near the critical point <m>c</m> (so <m>f'(c) = 0</m>), then <m>f(c)</m> is a local minimum if <m>f''(c) &gt; 0</m> and <m>f(c)</m> is a local maximum if <m>f''(c) &lt; 0</m>.

                    forces <m>x=0,\pm1</m>.

                        <li>Solve the resulting optimization problem.</li>
                    </ol>
                    We need to minimize costs, which means we need to minimize how much material is used to construct this box.
                    Hence we must minimize the surface area of the box.
                    If we let <m>x</m> denote the length of the base of the box and <m>h</m> the height of the box, then the surface area is given by
                    <me>x^{2} + 4xh.</me>
                    Now, we can't minimize this yet because we have too many variables.
                    However, we can solve for <m>h</m> in terms of <m>x</m> by using the volume constraint.
                    Since the volume of the box is <m>x^{2}h = 32000,</m> this gives <m>h = \frac{32000}{x^{2}}.</m>
                    So the quantity we need to minimize is
                    <me>f(x) = x^{2} + 4xh = x^{2} + \frac{128000}{x}.</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To minimize this, we find the critical points by solving <m>f'(x) = 0</m>.
                    This gives, after some algebra, <m>x = 40</m>.
                    Now we need to be careful here! We only have a critical point at this step.
                    We need to make an argument now as to why this critical point should be an absolute minimum of <m>f(x)</m>.
                    One way to do this is by setting up a sign chart for <m>f'(x)</m>.
                    If we do this, then we see that <m>f' &lt; 0</m> for <m>x</m> in <m>(0,40)</m>, while <m>f' &gt; 0</m> for <m>x</m> in <m>(40,\infty)</m>.
                    If we think about what this tells us of the graph of <m>f(x)</m>, we see that <m>x=40</m> must minimize <m>f(x)</m>, at least for <m>x &gt; 0</m>.
                    So the dimensions that minimize the cost of building this box are <m>40\times40\times20</m>.

                <p>
                    This is an optimization problem since we're trying to maximize distance.
                    There are two things we need to do:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Find the function we need to optimize.</li>
                        <li>Find the extrema.</li>
                    </ol>
                    The function we need to optimize is just the distance function.
                    In particular, if <m>(x,y)</m> is a point on the ellipse then we need to maximize
                    <me>d = \sqrt{(x-1)^{2} + (y-0)^{2}}.</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, we have a constraint that <m>(x,y)</m> must satisfy; namely, this must lie on the ellipse <m>4x^{2} + y^{2} = 4</m>.
                    This means that <m>y^{2} = 4 - 4x^{2}</m>, and if we plug this into our distance function we get
                    <me>d = \sqrt{(x-1)^{2} + (y-0)^{2}} = \sqrt{(x-1)^{2} + 4 - 4x^{2}}.</me>
                    Now here's a trick we can use: maximizing <m>d</m> is the same thing as maximizing <m>d^{2}</m>, but <m>d^{2}</m> is <em>much</em> nicer to work with algebraically.
                    So instead of maximizing <m>d</m>, we'll maximize the function
                    <me>f(x) = d^{2} = (x-1)^{2} + 4 - 4x^{2}.</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We'll start by finding it's local extrema, which means we need to find the critical points.
                    These are the solutions of <m>f'(x) = 0</m>.
                    Since
                    <me>f'(x) = 2x - 2 - 8x = -6x - 2,</me>
                    we see that the only critical point is <m>x = -\frac{1}{3}</m>.
                    Since <m>f''(x) = -6 &lt; 0</m>, this means that <m>x = -\frac{1}{3}</m> gives us a local maximum of <m>f(x)</m> by the second derivative test.
                    In fact, we can go further: this must be an absolute maximum of <m>f(x)</m>, since <m>f(x)</m> is always concave down (it's actually a parabola).
                </p>
                <p>
                    So the point on the ellipse <m>4x^{2} + y^{2} = 4</m> farthest from <m>(1,0)</m> has <m>x</m>-coordinate equal to <m>-\frac{1}{3}</m>.
                    This means that the corresponding <m>y</m>-coordinate is <m>y = \pm\frac{2\sqrt{5}}{3},</m> so the points on the ellipse that are the farthest from <m>(1,0)</m> are the points <m>(-\frac{1}{3}, -\frac{2\sqrt{5}}{3}), (-\frac{1}{3}, \frac{2\sqrt{5}}{3}).</m>

        <p>
            Consider a differentiable function <m>f(x)</m>, and suppose we want to find a root of <m>f(x)</m>, which is a number <m>x_{0}</m> such that <m>f(x_{0}) = 0</m>.
            In some cases this is very easy (like <m>f(x) = x^{2} + 2x + 1</m>), but in others this may be more complicated (such as <m>f(x) = x^{5} - x  - 1</m>).
            So we'd like to find a way to <em>approximate</em> the root <m>x_{0}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <term>Newton's Method</term> begins as follows: pick some starting point, or guess, <m>x_{1}</m>.
            Then draw the tangent line <m>L</m> to the graph of <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x_{1}</m>.
            Now, the <m>x</m>-intercept of this line may not be a root, but hopefully it'll be closer to the root.
            So call this point <m>x_{2}</m>.
            We can solve for <m>x_{2}</m> (if <m>f'(x_{1})\neq0</m>) to get
            <me>x_{2} = x_{1} - \frac{f(x_{1})}{f'(x_{1})}.</me>
            Now, at this point <m>x_{2}</m> is (hopefully!) a better approximation to the root <m>x_{0}</m> than <m>x_{1}</m>, and we can run through the same procedure to get a new point <m>x_{3}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In general, we can get a <term>sequence</term> of approximations <m>x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}</m> to the root <m>x_{0}</m> by using the formula
            <me>x_{n+1} = x_{n} - \frac{f(x_{n})}{f'(x_{n})},</me>
            as long as <m>f'(x_{n}) \neq0</m>.

                    We need to find a function <m>f(x)</m> for which <m>f(\pi) = 0</m>.
                    Perhaps the easiest is <m>f(x) = \sin x</m>.
                    Now, to use Newton's method we also need a starting guess.
                    We'll pick <m>x_{1} = 3</m> since this is close to <m>\pi</m>.
                    Then

                <p>
                    To use Newton's method, we need to come up with a function <m>f(x)</m> whose root is <m>\sqrt{a}</m>.
                    A simple choice for this is <m>f(x) = x^{2} - a</m>, since <m>f(\sqrt{a}) = 0</m>.
                    Now, if we're getting some sequence <m>x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}</m> from Newton's method then the next term in the sequence is
                    <me>x_{n+1} = x_{n} - \frac{f(x_{n})}{f'(x_{n})} = x_{n} - \frac{x_{n}^{2} - a}{2x_{n}}.</me>
                    After some algebra, we can rewrite this as
                    <me>x_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2}\left(x_{n} + \frac{a}{x_{n}}\right).</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can actually test this algorithm out.
                    Say we want to approximate <m>\sqrt{5}</m>.
                    A reasonable guess would be <m>x_{1} = 2</m>, since this should be close to <m>\sqrt{5}</m>.
                    Then we get

                        <mrow>x_{2} &amp; = \frac{1}{2}\left(2 + \frac{5}{2}\right) = 2.25 </mrow>
                        <mrow>x_{3} &amp; = \frac{1}{2}\left(2.25 + \frac{5}{2.25}\right) \approx 2.236111111 </mrow>

                    </md>
                    So it looks like <m>\sqrt{5}\approx 2.23606797</m>, and indeed this is quite close to the actual value of <m>\sqrt{5} = 2.236067977\ldots</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can go one step further for this algorithm.
                    If <m>x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n},\ldots</m> is the sequence we obtain using Newton's method for approximating <m>\sqrt{a}</m>, then as we saw earlier
                    <me>x_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2}\left(x_{n} + \frac{a}{x_{n}}\right).</me>
                    Now, assume that <m>\lim_{n\to\infty}x_{n}</m> exists and is nonzero, and call it <m>s</m>.
                    Then
                    <me>\lim_{n\to\infty}x_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\lim_{n\to\infty}x_{n} + \frac{a}{\lim_{n\to\infty}x_{n}}\right)</me>
                    becomes
                    <me>s = \frac{1}{2}\left(s + \frac{a}{s}\right)</me>
                    which we can rearrange to get
                    <me>s^{2} = \frac{1}{2}(s^{2} + a),</me>
                    or just <m>s^{2} = a</m>.
                    Hence <m>s = \pm\sqrt{a}</m>.

                    <me>F(x) + C</me>
                    where <m>C</m> is an arbitrary constant.

            <proof>
                <p>
                    It might not seem like this statement requires a proof, but it does!
                    We can check very easily that every function of the form <m>F(x)+C</m> is an antiderivative of <m>f(x)</m>, but how do we know every antiderivative takes this form?
                    To prove this, let <m>G(x)</m> be an arbitrary antiderivative of <m>f(x)</m>.
                    Then we need to show that <m>G(x) = F(x) + C</m>, or equivalently that <m>G(x) - F(x) = C</m>.
                    We can do this by taking the derivative of <m>G(x) - F(x)</m> to get
                    <me>G'(x) - F'(x) = f(x) - f(x) = 0,</me>
                    and so by <xref ref="theorem-zero-derivative-theorem" text="type-global" /> we know that <m>G(x) - F(x)</m> must be constant on <m>I</m>.
                    Hence <m>G(x) - F(x) = C</m> for some constant <m>C</m>, or equivalently <m>G(x) = F(x)+C</m>.
                    Therefore <em>every</em> antiderivative of <m>f(x)</m> can be written as <m>F(x) + C</m>.

            It might seem superfluous, but typically when dealing with models requiring us to find antiderivatives we'll want to find the most general antiderivative somewhere along the way.

                    We have two cases we need to consider, since the domain of <m>f(x)</m> consists of two intervals.
                    First, suppose that <m>x</m> is in <m>(0,\infty)</m>.
                    Then we know that <m>\dv{}{x}\ln x = \frac{1}{x}</m>, so on this interval the most general antiderivative of <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> is <m>\ln x + C_{1}</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now let <m>x</m> be in <m>(-\infty,0)</m>.
                    Then <m>\ln x</m> isn't defined here.
                    However, we can write
                    <me>\frac{1}{x} = -\frac{1}{-x},</me>
                    and if <m>x &lt; 0</m> then <m>-x &gt; 0</m> and <m>\ln(-x)</m> is defined, and in fact
                    <me>\dv{}{x}\ln(-x) = -\frac{1}{(-x)} = \frac{1}{x}.</me>
                    So the most general antiderivative of <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> on <m>(-\infty,0)</m> is <m>\ln(-x) + C_{2}</m>.
                    Putting this all together, we can say that the most general antiderivative of <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m> is given by
                    <me>F(x) = \begin{cases} \ln x + C_{1} &amp; x &gt; 0 \\ \ln(-x) + C_{2} &amp; x &lt; 0\end{cases}.</me>
                    If we know that we're only selecting values of <m>x</m> with the same sign, then we can just say that the antiderivative of <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> is <m>\ln|x| + C</m>.

            <solution>
                <p>
                    The first antiderivative isn't too hard; it's just <m>\tan t+C</m>.
                    The second is a little more complicated but still not too bad.
                    Since <m>\dv{}{t}\sec t = \sec t\tan t</m>, a good guess for an antiderivative of <m>-2\sec3t\tan3t</m> would be <m>-2\sec3t.</m>
                    However, the derivative of this is <m>-6\sec3t\tan3t</m>, so we're off by a factor of <m>3</m>.
                    So we just need to divide our guess by <m>3</m> to correct for this.
                    Hence the general antiderivative of <m>-2\sec3t\tan3t</m> is <m>-\frac{2}{3}\sec3t</m>.

                <p>
                    An object is dropped from a height of <quantity><mag>100</mag><unit base="meter"/></quantity> above sea level and falls with downward acceleration equal to <quantity><mag>9.8</mag><unit base="meter"/><per base="second" exp="2"/></quantity>.
                    Find the height <m>h(t)</m> of the object <m>t</m> seconds after it's dropped.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    Take downward to be the negative direction and sea level to be <m>h=0</m>.
                    Since acceleration is the second derivative of position, then the position (i.e. height) of the object should be the second <em>antiderivative</em> of acceleration.
                    At this step, it's tempting to say that since <m>h''(t) = -9.8</m>, we have
                    <me>h'(t) = -9.8t\quad\text{and}\quad h(t) = -4.9 t^{2}</me>.
                    And indeed, <m>-4.9t^{2}</m> is a function whose second derivative is <m>-9.8</m>.
                    However, we have a slight problem here.
                    We know that <m>h(0) = 100</m> and <m>h'(0) = 0</m>.
                    If <m>h(t) = -4.9t^{2}</m>, then it's impossible for <m>h(0)</m> to equal <m>100</m>.
                    The problem here is we forgot about the arbitrary constants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To get an accurate expression for <m>h(t)</m>, we go back to <m>h''(t) = -9.8</m>.
                    Then <m>h'(t) = -9.8t+C_{1}</m> for some constant <m>C_{1}</m>.
                    Since <m>h'(0) = 0</m>, this forces <m>C_{1} = 0</m>.
                    So we have <m>h'(t) = -9.8t</m>.
                    Now we antidifferentiate one more time to get <m>h(t) = -4.9t^{2} + C_{2}</m>.
                    Since <m>h(0) = 100</m>, this forces <m>C_{2} = 100</m>.
                    So <me>h(t) = -4.9t^{2} + 100</me>.

            Some functions that do not have an obvious antiderivative can be simplified through algebra into a form that is perhaps more helpful.

                <p>
                    It's tough to think of a function whose derivative is <m>f(x)</m>, though since the denominator is <m>1+x^{2}</m> it seems likely that this antiderivative will involve <m>\tan^{-1}x</m> in some way.
                    In order to actually find the antiderivative, we'll rewrite <m>f(x)</m> into a more convenient form.
                    First, note that the numerator is very close to the denominator, which means we can almost cancel it out.
                    So we'll split up the numerator as follows:
                    <me>\frac{2+x^{2}}{1+x^{2}} = \frac{1+(1+x^{2})}{1+x^{2}} = \frac{1}{1+x^{2}} + 1.</me>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can find the antiderivative of this term by term, so the most general antiderivative of <m>f(x)</m> is
                    <me>F(x) = \tan^{-1}x + x + C.</me>
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>
        <p>
            At this point, it's natural to think about what an antiderivative means geometrically since the derivative of a function has such a nice interpretation.
            One approach to this is to think about <term>net change</term> of the antiderivative.
            Let <m>F(x)</m> be an antiderivative of <m>f(x)</m> on some interval containing <m>a,b</m>.
            The net change of <m>F(x)</m> from <m>x=a</m> to <m>x=b</m> is given by
            <me>F(b) - F(a).</me>
            Now, <m>F'(x) = f(x)</m> represents instantaneous rate of change, not net change.
            However, if we can somehow add these instantaneous changes from <m>x=a</m> to <m>x=b</m>, they should accumulate until they give the net change of <m>F</m> from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m>.
            Graphically, adding these instantaneous rates of change looks like it's giving us the <em>area</em> under <m>f(x)</m>, which suggests the following geometric interpretation: <em>the area under of <m>f(x)</m> from <m>x=a</m> to <m>x=b</m> is just the net change of an antiderivative <m>F(x)</m> from <m>x=a</m> to <m>x=b</m>.</em>
            Much of the next chapter is devoted to making this idea precise.
