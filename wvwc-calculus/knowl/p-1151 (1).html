<p>As one example of torque, consider a wrench applied to a bolt. The force is exerted at the end of the wrench, and the torque is a vector that's parallel to the axis of rotation of the bolt. The torque is greater if the force is applied at a direction perpendicular (or nearly so) to that of the wrench, and smaller if the force is nearly parallel to the direction of the wrench. As a quick check, the torque is \(\vv{0}\) if the force is exactly parallel to the direction of the wrench, which makes sense: if we're pushing or pulling the wrench, the bolt won't rotate at all.</p>
