<p>If we're dealing with a function on a (bounded) closed interval, we need to introduce some new terminology. We say that a function \(f(x)\) is <dfn class="terminology">continuous from the left</dfn> at \(x=a\) if \(\lim_{x\to a^{-}}f(x) = f(a)\text{.}\) Similarly, we say that \(f(x)\) is <dfn class="terminology">continuous from the right</dfn> at \(x=a\) if \(\lim_{x\to a^{+}}f(x) = f(a)\text{.}\) This is of course assuming that \(a\) is in the domain of \(f(x)\text{.}\) Finally, we say that \(f(x)\) is continuous on the closed interval \([a,b]\) if it is continuous on \((a,b)\text{,}\) continuous from the right at \(a\) and continuous from the left at \(b\text{.}\) The main idea is still that the graph contains no gaps over this interval.</p>
