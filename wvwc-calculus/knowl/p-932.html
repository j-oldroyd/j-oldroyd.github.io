<p>Suppose we want to find the acute angle \(\theta\) these lines make with each other. We can do so by finding vectors \(\vv{a}\) and \(\vv{b}\) that point in the same directions as these lines. We'll start by finding the vector \(\vv{a}\) which points in the same direction as the line \(x+2y=7\text{.}\) To do so, we need two points on this line: \(A_{1} = (7,0)\) and \(A_{2} = (5,1)\text{.}\) So we can take \(\vv{a}\) to be</p>
