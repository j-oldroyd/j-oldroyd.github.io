<p>As the name suggests, any (non-vertical) line is an example of a linear function. Such functions are completely determined by the slope of the corresponding line and the \(y\)-intercept. <aside class="aside aside-like"><p>Equivalently, any line is determined by knowing two distinct points on the line.</p></aside> In particular, if \(y = mx + b\) then \(m\) is the slope and \(b\) is the \(y\)-intercept. This is known as the <em class="emphasis">slope-intercept</em> equation of a line. Equations of lines are also often written in <em class="emphasis">point-slope form</em> as \(y - y_{0} = m(x - x_{0})\text{.}\)</p>
