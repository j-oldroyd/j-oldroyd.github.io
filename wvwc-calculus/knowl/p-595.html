<p>As we'll see later, work is also the integral of force, so let's examine the force on the object. If we neglect air resistance and assume that the only force acting on the object is gravity, then the force exerted on the object is given by</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
F(r) = \frac{m_{E}m_{O}}{r^{2}}G,
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">where <span class="process-math">\(m_{E}\)</span> is the mass of the Earth, <span class="process-math">\(m_{O}\)</span> is still the mass of the object, <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is the distance from the center of mass of the Earth to the center of mass of the object, and <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> is the gravitational constant. Now assume that the Earth is a sphere of radius <span class="process-math">\(R_{0}\text{,}\)</span> and that the object has enough velocity to move it a distance of <span class="process-math">\(R_{1}\)</span> units from the surface of the Earth. Then the total work done in moving the object this distance is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\int_{R_{0}}^{R_{1}}F(r)\,dr = m_{E}m_{O}G\int_{R_{0}}^{R_{1}}\frac{1}{r^{2}}\,dr.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Now let's think about should happen if the object is at escape velocity. In this case, theoretically at least, there should be no limit to the distance the object can travel if given enough time. So what's the total work done?</p>
