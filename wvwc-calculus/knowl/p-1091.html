<p>Note the use of brackets here, since technically we are saying that the vector \(\vv{x}\) is distinct from the point \((3,-1)\text{,}\) even though they are closely related. We say that the <dfn class="terminology">position vector</dfn> of a point is the vector whose components are the same as the coordinates of the point. Geometrically, the position vector of a point \(P\) is the vector with its tail at the origin and its tip at \(P\text{.}\)</p>
