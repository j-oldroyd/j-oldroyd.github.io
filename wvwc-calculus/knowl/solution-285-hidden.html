<p>At \((-1,0)\text{,}\) \(\div\vb{F} = y = 0\text{.}\) At this particular point, outflow is balanced with inflow. Likewise, at \((0,-1)\) we can see that inflow is greater than outflow.</p>
<p>We can compute the net divergence as \(\iint_{D}\div\vb{F}\,dA\text{,}\) where \(D\) is the interior of the unit circle. This is equal to \(0\text{,}\) which means the net flow throughout \(D\) is \(0\text{.}\) By <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-green-s-theorem-for-flux-integrals.html" title="Theorem 14.4.5: Green's Theorem for Flux Integrals">TheoremÂ 14.4.5</a>, this is also equal to the net flux across \(C\text{.}\)</p>
