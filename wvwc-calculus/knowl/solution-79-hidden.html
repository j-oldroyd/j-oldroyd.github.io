<p>There are two things we need to do here:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Find the quantity to be optimize.</li>
<li>Solve the resulting optimization problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>We need to minimize costs, which means we need to minimize how much material is used to construct this box. Hence we must minimize the surface area of the box. If we let \(x\) denote the length of the base of the box and \(h\) the height of the box, then the surface area is given by</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
x^{2} + 4xh.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Now, we can't minimize this yet because we have too many variables. However, we can solve for \(h\) in terms of \(x\) by using the volume constraint. Since the volume of the box is \(x^{2}h = 32000,\) this gives \(h = \frac{32000}{x^{2}}.\) So the quantity we need to minimize is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = x^{2} + 4xh = x^{2} + \frac{128000}{x}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>To minimize this, we find the critical points by solving \(f'(x) = 0\text{.}\) This gives, after some algebra, \(x = 40\text{.}\) Now we need to be careful here! We only have a critical point at this step. We need to make an argument now as to why this critical point should be an absolute minimum of \(f(x)\text{.}\) One way to do this is by setting up a sign chart for \(f'(x)\text{.}\) If we do this, then we see that \(f' &lt; 0\) for \(x\) in \((0,40)\text{,}\) while \(f' &gt; 0\) for \(x\) in \((40,\infty)\text{.}\) If we think about what this tells us of the graph of \(f(x)\text{,}\) we see that \(x=40\) must minimize \(f(x)\text{,}\) at least for \(x &gt; 0\text{.}\) So the dimensions that minimize the cost of building this box are \(40\times40\times20\text{.}\)</p>
