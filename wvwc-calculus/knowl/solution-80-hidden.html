<p>This is an optimization problem since we're trying to maximize distance. There are two things we need to do: </p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>Find the function we need to optimize.</li>
<li>Find the extrema.</li>
</ol>
<p> The function we need to optimize is just the distance function. In particular, if \((x,y)\) is a point on the ellipse then we need to maximize</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
d = \sqrt{(x-1)^{2} + (y-0)^{2}}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Now, we have a constraint that \((x,y)\) must satisfy; namely, this must lie on the ellipse \(4x^{2} + y^{2} = 4\text{.}\) This means that \(y^{2} = 4 - 4x^{2}\text{,}\) and if we plug this into our distance function we get</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
d = \sqrt{(x-1)^{2} + (y-0)^{2}} = \sqrt{(x-1)^{2} + 4 - 4x^{2}}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Now here's a trick we can use: maximizing \(d\) is the same thing as maximizing \(d^{2}\text{,}\) but \(d^{2}\) is <em class="emphasis">much</em> nicer to work with algebraically. So instead of maximizing \(d\text{,}\) we'll maximize the function</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = d^{2} = (x-1)^{2} + 4 - 4x^{2}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We'll start by finding it's local extrema, which means we need to find the critical points. These are the solutions of \(f'(x) = 0\text{.}\) Since</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
f'(x) = 2x - 2 - 8x = -6x - 2,
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>we see that the only critical point is \(x = -\frac{1}{3}\text{.}\) Since \(f''(x) = -6 &lt; 0\text{,}\) this means that \(x = -\frac{1}{3}\) gives us a local maximum of \(f(x)\) by the second derivative test. In fact, we can go further: this must be an absolute maximum of \(f(x)\text{,}\) since \(f(x)\) is always concave down (it's actually a parabola).</p>
<p>So the point on the ellipse \(4x^{2} + y^{2} = 4\) farthest from \((1,0)\) has \(x\)-coordinate equal to \(-\frac{1}{3}\text{.}\) This means that the corresponding \(y\)-coordinate is \(y = \pm\frac{2\sqrt{5}}{3},\) so the points on the ellipse that are the farthest from \((1,0)\) are the points \((-\frac{1}{3}, -\frac{2\sqrt{5}}{3}), (-\frac{1}{3}, \frac{2\sqrt{5}}{3}).\)</p>
