<p>Part of the reason why finding the area in <a data-knowl="./knowl/example-area-with-changing-limits.html" title="Example 7.1.3: Area with Changing Limits">ExampleÂ 7.1.3</a> was more complicated was because the curves did not represent functions of \(x\text{.}\) However, we can view each curve as representing a function of \(y\text{,}\) namely, \(x(y) = y^{4} \quad\text{and}\quad x(y) = 2 - y^{2}.\) Then the area can be found as \(\int_{-1}^{1}[(2 - y^{2}) - y^{4}]\,dy = \frac{44}{15}.\) So it can be much easier if we find the area by integrating with respect to \(y\) as opposed to \(x\text{.}\)</p>
