<p>We have a <em class="emphasis">lot</em> of information to process here, so we'll take things a step at a time. The changing quantities are</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
h(t) &amp; = \text{height of water} \\
r(t) &amp; = \text{radius of water} \\
V(t) &amp; = \text{volume of water} 
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>where \(t\) is in minutes. We need to find the rate at which water is entering the tank, so let's call this mystery number \(C\text{.}\) Then all we know about \(C\) is that it's related to the rate that the volume is changing. In particular, we should have \(V' = C - 10000\text{.}\) So to find \(C\) we need to find \(V'\text{,}\) which means we need to set up a relationship between \(V\) and the other changing quantities to determine how exactly \(V\) is changing, using the fact that \(h' = 20\) when \(h=200\) (after converting to centimeters).</p>
<p>Using the fact that the water is in a conical tank, we can use the formula for the volume of a cone to say that \(V = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^{2}h\text{.}\) If we differentiate both sides with respect to \(t\text{,}\) then we get</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
V' = \frac{1}{3}\pi (2rr'h + r^{2}h').
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Unfortunately, we don't have any information on \(r\) or \(r'\) that we can use, just information on \(h\) and \(h'\text{.}\) So we need to get \(r\) in terms of \(h\text{.}\) By similar triangles, we can say that \(\frac{r}{h} = \frac{200}{600} = \frac{1}{3}\text{,}\) and so \(r = \frac{h}{3}\) and likewise \(r' = \frac{h'}{3}\text{.}\) Hence</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
V' = \frac{1}{3}\pi (2rr'h + r^{2}h') = \frac{1}{3}\pi \left(2\frac{h^{2}h'}{9} + \frac{h^{2}h'}{9}\right)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which boils down to</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
V' = \frac{h^{2}h'}{9}\pi = \frac{800000\pi}{9}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Now, <em class="emphasis">finally</em>, we can answer the original question. The rate that water is flowing into the tank is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
C = V' + 10000 = \frac{800000\pi}{9} + 10000,
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>or just 289252.68 <sup>cm<sup>3</sup></sup>⁄<sub>min</sub>. In terms of meters this is .29 <sup>m<sup>3</sup></sup>⁄<sub>min</sub>, which perhaps looks a bit more reasonable.</p>
