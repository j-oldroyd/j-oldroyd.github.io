<p>What we want to do now is measure how much a curve "turns" at some point. First, we call a space curve \(\vv{r}(t)\) <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">smooth</dfn> on some interval \(I\) if \(\vv{r}'(t)\neq0\) for any \(t\) in \(I\text{.}\) Now, if we want to measure how quickly a curve is changing direction then we can use the unit tangent vector \(\vv{T}(t)\) to measure this. In particular, the derivative of the unit tangent should provide a good measure of how quickly a curve turns. However, we don't want to let the specific parametrization of the curve affect this; in other words, the rate at which a curve is turning should not depend on the speed at which the curve is traveled. This leads to the following definition.</p>
