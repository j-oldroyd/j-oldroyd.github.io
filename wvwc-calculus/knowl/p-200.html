<p>We have a <em class="emphasis">lot</em> of information to process here, so we'll take things a step at a time. The changing quantities are</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
h(t) &amp; = \text{height of water} \\
r(t) &amp; = \text{radius of water} \\
V(t) &amp; = \text{volume of water} 
\end{align*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">where \(t\) is in minutes. We need to find the rate at which water is entering the tank, so let's call this mystery number \(C\text{.}\) Then all we know about \(C\) is that it's related to the rate that the volume is changing. In particular, we should have \(V' = C - 10000\text{.}\) So to find \(C\) we need to find \(V'\text{,}\) which means we need to set up a relationship between \(V\) and the other changing quantities to determine how exactly \(V\) is changing, using the fact that \(h' = 20\) when \(h=200\) (after converting to centimeters).</p>
