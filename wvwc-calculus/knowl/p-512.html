<p>Here, it doesn't make much difference what we select for \(u\) or \(dv\text{,}\) since both \(e^{t}\) and \(\cos t\) are easy to differentiate and integrate, while neither becomes simpler. But since we're integrating a product, we'll try to use integration by parts anyway and hope for the best. To that end, let \(u = e^{t}\) and \(dv = \cos t\text{.}\) Then \(du = e^{t}\,dt\) and \(v = \sin t\text{,}\) which gives</p>
