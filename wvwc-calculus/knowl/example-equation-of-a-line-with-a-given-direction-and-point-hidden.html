<body><article class="example-like"><p>Suppose we want to find the equation of a line \(L\) that passes through \((2,5,-3)\) and is perpendicular to \(\vv{u} = \dotprod{2,1,2}\text{.}\) <a knowl="./knowl/theorem-parametric-equations-of-a-line.html" title="Theorem 9.5.4: Parametric Equations of a Line">TheoremÂ 9.5.4</a> says that we only need to find the right choices for \(\vv{r}_{0}\) and \(\vv{v}\) in order to get the equation of such a line, and we can write down one of these right away:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\vv{r}_{0} = \dotprod{2,5,-3}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>So we just need to find \(\vv{v}\text{.}\) Since \(L\) is orthogonal to \(\vv{u} = \dotprod{2,1,2}\text{,}\) this means we want \(\vv{v}\) to be orthogonal to \(\vv{u}\) as well. A great way to find such a \(\vv{v}\) is to use the cross product. If \(\vv{w}\) is any nonzero vector, then \(\vv{u}\times\vv{w}\) must be orthogonal to both \(\vv{u}\) and \(\vv{w}\text{,}\) and in particular it must be orthogonal to \(\vv{u}\text{.}\) So we can take</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\vv{v} = \dotprod{2,1,2}\times\vv{i} = \dotprod{0,2,-1}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>So the equation of this line is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\vv{r} = \dotprod{2,1+2t,2-t}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>As \(t\) varies, this will trace out our line.</p></article></body>
