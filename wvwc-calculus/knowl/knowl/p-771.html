<p>In millions, the population of the USA in 1990 was \(250\) and was growing at a rate of \(3.1\) per year. In 2012, the population was \(314\) and was growing at a rate of \(2.3\) per year. Assuming that the population of the USA grows logistically, estimate the population of the USA in 2017 and compare it to the current estimate of \(325.7\text{.}\)</p>
