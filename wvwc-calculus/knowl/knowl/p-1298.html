<p>Suppose some particle travels along the space curve given by \(\vv{r}(t)\) for \(a\leq t\leq b\text{.}\) What we'd like to do is determine how far the particle travels over this time interval. Recall that distance is just speed multiplied by time, and the speed of this particle is given by \(\norm{\vv{r}'(t)}\text{.}\) So we can imagine that the distance traveled by this particle over some infinitesimal time interval \(dt\) to be given by \(\norm{\vv{r}'(t)}\,dt\text{.}\) So adding up all of these distances from \(t=a\) to \(t=b\) should give us the arc length. This suggests (but does not prove!) the following formula for arc length:</p>
