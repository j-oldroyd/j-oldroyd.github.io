<p>If we try to plug in \(x=4\) into \(\frac{x-3}{2x-8}\) we get \(\frac{1}{0}\text{,}\) which means we have run into a divide-by-zero problem. This is a good hint that the limit should be \(\pm\infty\text{,}\) we just need to figure out the correct sign. There are a couple ways we can do this. First, we could set up a sign chart for this function to see where it's positive and negative and then use that to see if it's increasing or decreasing without bound as \(x\to4^{-}\text{.}\) Second, we could just plug in values of \(x\) that are closer and closer to \(4\) and see how the function behaves. Either way, we see that it's negative for values of \(x\) that are close to (but less than) \(4\text{.}\) Hence \(\lim_{x\to4^{-}}\frac{x-3}{2x-8}=-\infty\text{.}\)</p>
