<p>For functions that depend on a single independent variable such as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> derivatives are useful because they represent how the function itself changes as the independent variable changes. However, there are many situations where it makes sense to consider functions of more than one independent variable. Therefore, we will want to extend the notion of derivative to include these functions as well. Our primary tool for this will be the <dfn class="terminology">partial derivative</dfn>, which we'll see in <a href="section-partial-derivatives.html" class="internal" title="Section 12.3: Partial Derivatives">SectionÂ 12.3</a>. But we'll need to build up some terminology to get there.</p>
