<p>To use <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/equation-integration-by-parts.html" title="Equation 7.1.1">(7.1.1)</a>, we need to write <span class="process-math">\(\int x\sin x\,dx\)</span> in the form <span class="process-math">\(\int u\,dv\text{.}\)</span> Once we have <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(dv\text{,}\)</span> then we can set up the rest of the formula. One thing that can make this method tricky is the fact that we can have many different choices for <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(dv\text{;}\)</span> the only thing we need for certain is for <span class="process-math">\(u\,dv = x\sin x\)</span> here. However, if we look at the formula <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/equation-integration-by-parts.html" title="Equation 7.1.1">(7.1.1)</a> then we'll see two new terms on the right hand side: <span class="process-math">\(du\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\text{,}\)</span> together in the second integral. This means that we'll need to differentiate <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and integrate <span class="process-math">\(v\text{,}\)</span> and this will suggest what both should be.</p>
