<p>The first antiderivative isn't too hard; it's just \(\tan t+C\text{.}\) The second is a little more complicated but still not too bad. Since \(\dv{}{t}\sec t = \sec t\tan t\text{,}\) a good guess for an antiderivative of \(-2\sec3t\tan3t\) would be \(-2\sec3t.\) However, the derivative of this is \(-6\sec3t\tan3t\text{,}\) so we're off by a factor of \(3\text{.}\) So we just need to divide our guess by \(3\) to correct for this. Hence the general antiderivative of \(-2\sec3t\tan3t\) is \(-\frac{2}{3}\sec3t\text{.}\)</p>
