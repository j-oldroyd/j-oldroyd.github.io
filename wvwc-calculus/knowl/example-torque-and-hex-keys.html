</h6>
<p>A hex key (Allen wrench) with a short arm of length 27 mm and a long arm length of 154 mm is applied to a screw, with the short arm attached to the screw. To turn the screw, a force of 0.5 N is applied to the long arm of the hex key turning the screw clockwise, and is exactly perpendicular to both the short arm and long arm of the hex key. We want to find the torque of this force on the screw.</p>
<p>One way we can do this is to imagine the screw sitting at the origin, and the hex key is (initially) in the \(xy\)-plane. Note that once the force is applied, it will begin to rotate the hex key out of the \(xy\)-plane. Now, the torque is defined by</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{\tau} = \vv{r}\times\vv{F}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where \(\vv{r}\) is the vector from the screw to the point where the force \(\vv{F}\) is applied. We can find \(\vv{r}\) without too much trouble: it's \(\vv{r} = \dotprod{.027,.154,0}\text{.}\) To find the force \(\vv{F}\text{,}\) note that it's perpendicular to both the long arm and short arm of the screw. So a starting guess would be</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\vv{F} = \dotprod{.027,0,0}\times\dotprod{0,.154,0} = \dotprod{0,0,.042}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Such a force would turn the screw clockwise, but it has the wrong magnitude. So we need to adjust it a bit: \(\vv{F} = \dotprod{0,0,.5}\text{.}\) So the torque is given by</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{\tau} &amp;= \vv{r}\times\vv{F} \\
&amp; = \dotprod{.027,.154,0}\times\dotprod{0,0,.5} \\
&amp; = \dotprod{.154,-.027,0}. 
\end{align*}
