<p>Since we need to compute \(du\text{,}\) then we want \(u\) to be easy to differentiate. Similarly, we want \(dv\) to be easy to integrate. And since we'd like to be able to compute this integral, we'd also like \(v\,du\) to be simpler than \(u\,dv\text{.}\) Now return to \(x\sin x\text{.}\) Since \(x\) gets simpler if we differentiate it by \(\sin x\) doesn't, this suggests that we should set \(u = x\text{.}\) And since \(u = x\text{,}\) we must have \(dv = \sin x\,dx\) (since \(dv\) automatically becomes whatever is left over). With these choices, we have</p>
