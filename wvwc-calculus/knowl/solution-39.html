<p>We have a <em class="emphasis">lot</em> of information to process here, so we'll take things a step at a time. The changing quantities are</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
h(t) &amp; = \text{height of water} \\
r(t) &amp; = \text{radius of water} \\
V(t) &amp; = \text{volume of water} 
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">where <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> is in minutes. We need to find the rate at which water is entering the tank, so let's call this mystery number <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> Then all we know about <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is that it's related to the rate that the volume is changing. In particular, we should have <span class="process-math">\(V' = C - 10000\text{.}\)</span> So to find <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> we need to find <span class="process-math">\(V'\text{,}\)</span> which means we need to set up a relationship between <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> and the other changing quantities to determine how exactly <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> is changing, using the fact that <span class="process-math">\(h' = 20\)</span> when <span class="process-math">\(h=200\)</span> (after converting to centimeters).</p>
<p>Using the fact that the water is in a conical tank, we can use the formula for the volume of a cone to say that <span class="process-math">\(V = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^{2}h\text{.}\)</span> If we differentiate both sides with respect to <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> then we get</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
V' = \frac{1}{3}\pi (2rr'h + r^{2}h').
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Unfortunately, we don't have any information on <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(r'\)</span> that we can use, just information on <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(h'\text{.}\)</span> So we need to get <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> in terms of <span class="process-math">\(h\text{.}\)</span> By similar triangles, we can say that <span class="process-math">\(\frac{r}{h} = \frac{200}{600} = \frac{1}{3}\text{,}\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(r = \frac{h}{3}\)</span> and likewise <span class="process-math">\(r' = \frac{h'}{3}\text{.}\)</span> Hence</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
V' = \frac{1}{3}\pi (2rr'h + r^{2}h') = \frac{1}{3}\pi \left(2\frac{h^{2}h'}{9} + \frac{h^{2}h'}{9}\right)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">which boils down to</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
V' = \frac{h^{2}h'}{9}\pi = \frac{800000\pi}{9}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Now, <em class="emphasis">finally</em>, we can answer the original question. The rate that water is flowing into the tank is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
C = V' + 10000 = \frac{800000\pi}{9} + 10000,
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">or just <span class="quantity">289252.68 <sup>cm<sup>3</sup></sup>⁄<sub>min</sub></span>. In terms of meters this is <span class="quantity">.29 <sup>m<sup>3</sup></sup>⁄<sub>min</sub></span>, which perhaps looks a bit more reasonable.</p>
