<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">However, Newton's method of fluxions has some serious drawbacks. The primary issue raised with this approach is that, in ignoring \(o\) at the final step of the above calculation, Newton is essentially dividing by \(0\text{.}\) Mathematically, this method argument isn't rigorous. Newton later addressed this logical gap by treating \(o\) as a quantity that approached \(0\text{,}\) but was not actually infinitesimal. This approach is more mathematically sound as it treats \(o\) as a typical nonzero real number instead of some mysterious infinitesimal. Although it requires a bit more justification, this viewpoint leads to the concept of the <em class="emphasis">limit</em> which is at the foundation of modern calculus.</p>
