<p>Computing integrals in practice often involves setting up and approximating Riemann sums, i.e. sums of the form \(\sum_{i=1}^{n}f(x_{i}^{*})\Delta x_{i}\text{.}\) These sums depend on how we choose the sample points \(x_{i}^{*}\) from each interval \([x_{i-1},x_{i}]\text{.}\) We've mostly worked with \(x_{i}^{*} = x_{i}\text{,}\) or right endpoints. We could also choose \(x_{i}^{*} = x_{i-1}\text{,}\) using left endpoints. However, it's often more accurate to use <em class="emphasis">midpoints</em>: \(x_{i}^{*} = \frac{x_{i-1}+x_{i}}{2}\text{.}\) The reason for this is that if we choose midpoints of intervals as our sample points, these tend to be less affected than either endpoint if the function is increasing or decreasing. In particular, we have the <dfn class="terminology">midpoint rule</dfn>.</p>
