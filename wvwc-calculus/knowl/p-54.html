<p>Consider the function \(f(x)=\frac{1}{x}\text{.}\) We know from algebra that this function has a vertical asymptote at \(x=0\text{,}\) and so in particular is undefined there. However, just because it's undefined at \(x=0\) doesn't mean that we can't gather important information about the function near \(0\text{.}\) This is because the function behaves in a very specific way as we let \(x\) approach \(0\text{.}\) For example, if we let \(x\) approach \(0\) from the right, then \(f(x)\) increases without bound. Similarly, \(f(x)\) decreases without bound as \(x\) approaches \(0\) from the left.</p>
