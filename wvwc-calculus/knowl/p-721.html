<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Although there are important forces that are reasonably approximated by constants, such as the force due to gravity, this isn't reasonable for every force of interest. For example, consider the force due to drag against an object moving through the atmosphere, which should increase as velocity increases. Another basic example is the <dfn class="terminology">Hooke's Law</dfn>, which states that the force a spring exerts on an attached mass is proportional to the displacement of the mass from the spring's equilibrium position. For these non-constant forces, our old formula doesn't work so well. To be precise, how can we measure the work done by a non-constant force \(F(x)\) on a particle as it moves from \(x = a\) to \(x = b\text{?}\)</p>
