<p>We have a <em class="emphasis">lot</em> of information to process here, so we'll take things a step at a time. The changing quantities are</p>

\begin{align*}
h(t) &amp; = \text{height of water} \\

<p class="continuation">where <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> is in minutes. We need to find the rate at which water is entering the tank, so let's call this mystery number <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> Then all we know about <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is that it's related to the rate that the volume is changing. In particular, we should have <span class="process-math">\(V' = C - 10000\text{.}\)</span> So to find <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> we need to find <span class="process-math">\(V'\text{,}\)</span> which means we need to set up a relationship between <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> and the other changing quantities to determine how exactly <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> is changing, using the fact that <span class="process-math">\(h' = 20\)</span> when <span class="process-math">\(h=200\)</span> (after converting to centimeters).</p>
