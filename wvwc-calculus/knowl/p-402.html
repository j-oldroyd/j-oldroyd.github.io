<p>At this point, it's natural to think about what an antiderivative means geometrically since the derivative of a function has such a nice interpretation. One approach to this is to think about <dfn class="terminology">net change</dfn> of the antiderivative. Let \(F(x)\) be an antiderivative of \(f(x)\) on some interval containing \(a,b\text{.}\) The net change of \(F(x)\) from \(x=a\) to \(x=b\) is given by</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
F(b) - F(a).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Now, \(F'(x) = f(x)\) represents instantaneous rate of change, not net change. However, if we can somehow add these instantaneous changes from \(x=a\) to \(x=b\text{,}\) they should accumulate until they give the net change of \(F\) from \(a\) to \(b\text{.}\) Graphically, adding these instantaneous rates of change looks like it's giving us the <em class="emphasis">area</em> under \(f(x)\text{,}\) which suggests the following geometric interpretation: <em class="emphasis">the area under of \(f(x)\) from \(x=a\) to \(x=b\) is just the net change of an antiderivative \(F(x)\) from \(x=a\) to \(x=b\text{.}\)</em> Much of the next chapter is devoted to making this idea precise.</p>
