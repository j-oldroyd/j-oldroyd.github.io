<p>It's tough to think of a function whose derivative is \(f(x)\text{,}\) though since the denominator is \(1+x^{2}\) it seems likely that this antiderivative will involve \(\tan^{-1}x\) in some way. In order to actually find the antiderivative, we'll rewrite \(f(x)\) into a more convenient form. First, note that the numerator is very close to the denominator, which means we can almost cancel it out. So we'll split up the numerator as follows:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{2+x^{2}}{1+x^{2}} = \frac{1+(1+x^{2})}{1+x^{2}} = \frac{1}{1+x^{2}} + 1.
\end{equation*}
</div>
