<p>Since we need to integrate a product, and we can't easily do so with \(u\)-substitution or algebra, we'll try integration by parts. We could pick \(u = 3x^{2}\text{,}\) and this is certainly easy to differentiate so we can find \(du\text{.}\) However, doing so leaves us with \(dv = \ln x\text{,}\) which is tricky to integrate, but is easy to differentiate. So we'll try setting \(u = \ln x\) and \(dv = 3x^{2}\,dx\text{.}\) Then</p>
