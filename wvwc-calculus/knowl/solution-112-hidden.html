<p>Here, it doesn't make much difference what we select for \(u\) or \(dv\text{,}\) since both \(e^{t}\) and \(\cos t\) are easy to differentiate and integrate, while neither becomes simpler. But since we're integrating a product, we'll try to use integration by parts anyway and hope for the best. To that end, let \(u = e^{t}\) and \(dv = \cos t\text{.}\) Then \(du = e^{t}\,dt\) and \(v = \sin t\text{,}\) which gives</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\int e^{t}\cos t\,dt &amp; = uv - \int v\,du \\
&amp; = e^{t}\sin t - \int e^{t}\sin t\,dt. 
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>As expected, the new integral isn't any simpler than the one that we started with. However, it's not any more <em class="emphasis">complicated</em> either. So we'll try integration by parts on the new integral as well, with \(u = e^{t}, du = e^{t}\,dt, dv = \sin t\,dt\) and \(v = -\cos t\text{.}\) Then</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\int e^{t}\sin t\,dt = -e^{t}\cos t + \int e^{t}\cos t\,dt.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>So we have</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\int e^{t}\cos t\,dt &amp; = e^{t}\sin t - (-e^{t}\cos t + \int e^{t}\cos t\,dt) \\
&amp; = e^{t}\sin t + e^{t}\cos t - \int e^{t}\cos t\,dt 
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>There is something very strange about this equation: <em class="emphasis">the same integral appears on both sides</em>. This is no longer a calculus problem, it's an algebra problem! Solving for the integral algebraically (and including the arbitrary constant!) gives</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\int e^{t}\cos t\,dt = \frac{e^{t}\sin t + e^{t}\cos t}{2} + C.
\end{equation*}
</div>
