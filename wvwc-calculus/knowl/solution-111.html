<p>To use <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/equation-integration-by-parts.html" title="Equation 7.1.1">(7.1.1)</a>, we need to write <span class="process-math">\(\int x\sin x\,dx\)</span> in the form <span class="process-math">\(\int u\,dv\text{.}\)</span> Once we have <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(dv\text{,}\)</span> then we can set up the rest of the formula. One thing that can make this method tricky is the fact that we can have many different choices for <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(dv\text{;}\)</span> the only thing we need for certain is for <span class="process-math">\(u\,dv = x\sin x\)</span> here. However, if we look at the formula <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/equation-integration-by-parts.html" title="Equation 7.1.1">(7.1.1)</a> then we'll see two new terms on the right hand side: <span class="process-math">\(du\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\text{,}\)</span> together in the second integral. This means that we'll need to differentiate <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and integrate <span class="process-math">\(v\text{,}\)</span> and this will suggest what both should be.</p>
<p>Since we need to compute <span class="process-math">\(du\text{,}\)</span> then we want <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> to be easy to differentiate. Similarly, we want <span class="process-math">\(dv\)</span> to be easy to integrate. And since we'd like to be able to compute this integral, we'd also like <span class="process-math">\(v\,du\)</span> to be simpler than <span class="process-math">\(u\,dv\text{.}\)</span> Now return to <span class="process-math">\(x\sin x\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> gets simpler if we differentiate it by <span class="process-math">\(\sin x\)</span> doesn't, this suggests that we should set <span class="process-math">\(u = x\text{.}\)</span> And since <span class="process-math">\(u = x\text{,}\)</span> we must have <span class="process-math">\(dv = \sin x\,dx\)</span> (since <span class="process-math">\(dv\)</span> automatically becomes whatever is left over). With these choices, we have</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
du &amp; = \,dx \\
v &amp; = -\cos x 
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Therefore</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\int x\sin x\,dx &amp; = \int u\,dv \\
&amp; = uv - \int v\,du \\
&amp; = -x\cos x - \int (-\cos x)\,dx \\
&amp; = -x\cos x + \int\cos x\,dx \\
&amp; = -x\cos x + \sin x + C. 
\end{align*}
