<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Let \(\vv{r}(t) = \dotprod{\sin\pi t, t, \cos\pi t}\text{,}\) and suppose we want to sketch this function. One way to do so is to plug in values for \(t\) and connect the resulting points with a curve, but we can also do the following to get an idea of what this looks like. First, note that we have \(x = \sin\pi t\) and \(z=\cos\pi t\text{.}\) So \(x^{2}+z^{2} = 1\text{,}\) which means that this looks like the unit circle in the \(xz\)-plane, traced <em class="emphasis">clockwise</em>. Since we also have \(y=t\text{,}\) this curve moves farther along the \(y\)-axis as \(t\) increases. If we trace this out, we get a helix (see the below plot). We can also see from the graph that it has no jumps or gaps, so \(\vv{r}(t)\) is continuous everywhere.</p>
