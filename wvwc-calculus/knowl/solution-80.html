<p>There are two things we need to do here:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Find the quantity to be optimize.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve the resulting optimization problem.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="continuation">We need to minimize costs, which means we need to minimize how much material is used to construct this box. Hence we must minimize the surface area of the box. If we let <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> denote the length of the base of the box and <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> the height of the box, then the surface area is given by</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
x^{2} + 4xh.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Now, we can't minimize this yet because we have too many variables. However, we can solve for <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> in terms of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> by using the volume constraint. Since the volume of the box is <span class="process-math">\(x^{2}h = 32000,\)</span> this gives <span class="process-math">\(h = \frac{32000}{x^{2}}.\)</span> So the quantity we need to minimize is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = x^{2} + 4xh = x^{2} + \frac{128000}{x}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>To minimize this, we find the critical points by solving <span class="process-math">\(f'(x) = 0\text{.}\)</span> This gives, after some algebra, <span class="process-math">\(x = 40\text{.}\)</span> Now we need to be careful here! We only have a critical point at this step. We need to make an argument now as to why this critical point should be an absolute minimum of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\text{.}\)</span> One way to do this is by setting up a sign chart for <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\text{.}\)</span> If we do this, then we see that <span class="process-math">\(f' &lt; 0\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\((0,40)\text{,}\)</span> while <span class="process-math">\(f' &gt; 0\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\((40,\infty)\text{.}\)</span> If we think about what this tells us of the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\text{,}\)</span> we see that <span class="process-math">\(x=40\)</span> must minimize <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\text{,}\)</span> at least for <span class="process-math">\(x &gt; 0\text{.}\)</span> So the dimensions that minimize the cost of building this box are <span class="process-math">\(40\times40\times20\text{.}\)</span></p>
