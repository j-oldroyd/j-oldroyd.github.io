<p>One of our goals in this chapter is to adequately describe motion in space. A useful way to do this uses the concept of <dfn class="terminology">vector</dfn>, which we think of as a quantity that has both direction and magnitude/length. A simple example would be velocity: velocity in space has a direction and also a magnitude (speed). We will typically denote vectors by using boldface letters such as \(\vv{x}\) or letters with a bar overhead such as \(\bar{x}\text{.}\) We represent vectors as arrows with an <dfn class="terminology">initial point</dfn> and a <dfn class="terminology">terminal point</dfn>:</p>
