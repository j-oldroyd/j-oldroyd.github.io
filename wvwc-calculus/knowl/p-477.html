<p>By <a knowl="./knowl/theorem-fundamental-theorem-of-calculus.html" title="Theorem 5.4.2: Fundamental Theorem of Calculus">TheoremÂ 5.4.2</a>, we know that integration and differentiation are inverse operations. This means that differentiation rules, such as the chain rule and product rule, have corresponding <em class="emphasis">integration</em> rules. In this section we look at the integration rule corresponding to the chain rule, known as \(u\)-substitution, and in Calculus 2 you'll see the integration rule corresponding to the product rule.</p>
