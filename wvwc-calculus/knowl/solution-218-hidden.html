<body><div class="solution"><p>We can find this algebraically, but we'll try to answer this geometrically instead. First, note that \(z = \sqrt{1 - x^{2} - y^{2}}\) is actually the top half of the unit sphere. If we're trying to find where \(\pdv{z}{y}\) is zero, then we need to find where this surface is "flat" when moving in the \(y\) direction. If we think about this a bit, this should only occur when \(y=0\text{,}\) i.e. along the \(x\)-axis. At any other location on the unit sphere, moving in the \(y\)-direction on the unit sphere requires going uphill or downhill, which means \(z_{y}\neq0\) at these locations.</p></div></body>
