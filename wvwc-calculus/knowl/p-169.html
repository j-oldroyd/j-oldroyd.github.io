<p>At this point, we can take derivatives of sums, differences, products and quotients of functions. However, these rules aren't very useful for differentiating functions like <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = (3x^{2} + \sin x)^{50}\text{.}\)</span> We could technically evaluate <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> using these rules but it would be an awful way to spend your weekend. But if we make the substitution <span class="process-math">\(u = 3x^{2} + \sin x\text{,}\)</span> then we can rewrite <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(f(u) = u^{50}\text{,}\)</span> which is <em class="emphasis">much</em> easier to differentiate: <span class="process-math">\(\dv{f}{u} = 50u^{49}\text{.}\)</span> At this step we might be tempted to say that <span class="process-math">\(f'(x) = 50u^{49} = 50(3x^{2} + \sin x)^{49}\text{,}\)</span> but this isn't quite right. To get the actual derivative we need to consider how the new variable <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> depends on <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> as well. The <dfn class="terminology">Chain Rule</dfn> is what we need.</p>
