<p>To use <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/equation-integration-by-parts.html" title="Equation 7.1.1">(7.1.1)</a>, we need to write \(\int x\sin x\,dx\) in the form \(\int u\,dv\text{.}\) Once we have \(u\) and \(dv\text{,}\) then we can set up the rest of the formula. One thing that can make this method tricky is the fact that we can have many different choices for \(u\) and \(dv\text{;}\) the only thing we need for certain is for \(u\,dv = x\sin x\) here. However, if we look at the formula <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/equation-integration-by-parts.html" title="Equation 7.1.1">(7.1.1)</a> then we'll see two new terms on the right hand side: \(du\) and \(v\text{,}\) together in the second integral. This means that we'll need to differentiate \(u\) and integrate \(v\text{,}\) and this will suggest what both should be.</p>
<p>Since we need to compute \(du\text{,}\) then we want \(u\) to be easy to differentiate. Similarly, we want \(dv\) to be easy to integrate. And since we'd like to be able to compute this integral, we'd also like \(v\,du\) to be simpler than \(u\,dv\text{.}\) Now return to \(x\sin x\text{.}\) Since \(x\) gets simpler if we differentiate it by \(\sin x\) doesn't, this suggests that we should set \(u = x\text{.}\) And since \(u = x\text{,}\) we must have \(dv = \sin x\,dx\) (since \(dv\) automatically becomes whatever is left over). With these choices, we have</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
du &amp; = \,dx \\
v &amp; = -\cos x 
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Therefore</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\int x\sin x\,dx &amp; = \int u\,dv \\
&amp; = uv - \int v\,du \\
&amp; = -x\cos x - \int (-\cos x)\,dx \\
&amp; = -x\cos x + \int\cos x\,dx \\
&amp; = -x\cos x + \sin x + C. 
\end{align*}
