<p>If \(\vv{r}(t) = \dotprod{f(t),g(t),h(t)},\) then \(\vv{r}\) is differentiable if and only if \(f,g,h\) are, and \(\vv{r}'(t) = \dotprod{f'(t),g'(t),h'(t)}.\) Just as in Calculus I, the derivative represents how quickly a space curve is changing at some value of \(t\text{.}\) However, derivatives of vector functions also carry information about the <em class="emphasis">direction</em> a curve is moving. We call \(\vv{r}'(t)\) the <dfn class="terminology">tangent vector</dfn> to \(\vv{r}(t)\text{.}\) In particular, \(\vv{r}'(t)\) is parallel to the space curve \(\vv{r}\) at \(t\text{,}\) and its magnitude \(|\vv{r}'(t)|\) represents how quickly the curve is changing at \(t\text{.}\) If we only care about direction, then we can define the <dfn class="terminology">unit tangent</dfn> \(\vv{T}(t)\text{,}\) which is given by</p>
