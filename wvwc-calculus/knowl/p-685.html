<p>A mass attached to a spring is acted upon by a <dfn class="terminology">spring force</dfn> given by \(F(t) = -2x\text{,}\) where \(x\) is the displacement of the mass from the equilibrium position of the spring. Suppose that the mass is held 1â€¯m to the right of the spring's equilibrium position (so that the spring will try to pull the mass back towards its equilibrium which we'll say occurs at \(x = 0\)). What is the work done by the spring on the mass in moving the mass from its current position back to equilibrium?</p>
