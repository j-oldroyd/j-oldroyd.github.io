<p>Consider the equation \(z = \sin y\) in \(\RR^{3}\text{.}\) This equation is missing the variable \(x\text{,}\) which suggests that the graph of this equation should be a cylinder. However, it's not going to look like the cylinders we may be used to at this point. In fact, this is just the set of all lines passing through the curve \(z=\sin y\) in the \(yz\)-plane and parallel to the \(x\)-axis. It's graph is given below.</p>
