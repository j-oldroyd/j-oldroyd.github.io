<p>So the goal behind integrating with change of variables is to find relate the integral \(\iint_{D}f(x,y)\,dA\text{,}\) where \(D\) is in the \(xy\)-plane, to a new integral \(\iint_{R}f(g(u,v),h(u,v))\,dA\text{,}\) where \(R\) is in the \(uv\)-plane. The main issue with such a transformation is one that we're familiar with from working with polar coordinates: \(dA = dx\,dy\) in the first set of coordinates is not necessarily equal to \(du\,dv\) in the new set of coordinates. In general we'll need a scaling factor that depends on \(u\) and \(v\text{.}\) As it turns out, the proper scaling factor comes from a determinant.</p>
