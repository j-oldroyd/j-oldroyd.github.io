<p>Although it gets more difficult to assign a physical or geometric significance to higher order derivatives, we can still derive meaning from the second derivative. One interpretation of the second derivative is as acceleration, as shown in <a knowl="./knowl/example-acceleration-from-position.html" title="Example 2.2.8: Acceleration from position">ExampleÂ 2.2.8</a>, and it turns out there's a nice geometric interpretation as well. Recall that if \(f(x)\) is a function then \(f'(x)\) represents the slope, or rate of change, of the graph of \(f(x)\) at \(x\text{.}\) Therefore \(f''(x)\) represents the rate of change of the slope, i.e. how quickly the slope is increasing or decreasing. If \(f''(x) &gt;0\) then the slope of \(f(x)\) should be increasing, leading to a u-shaped graph. Conversely, if \(f''(x) &lt;0\) then the slope of \(f(x)\) should be decreasing, leading to an upside down u-shaped graph. This leads to the following definition.</p>
