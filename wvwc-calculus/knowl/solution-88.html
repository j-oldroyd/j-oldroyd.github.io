<p>Take downward to be the negative direction and sea level to be \(h=0\text{.}\) Since acceleration is the second derivative of position, then the position (i.e. height) of the object should be the second <em class="emphasis">antiderivative</em> of acceleration. At this step, it's tempting to say that since \(h''(t) = -9.8\text{,}\) we have</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
h'(t) = -9.8t\quad\text{and}\quad h(t) = -4.9 t^{2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>And indeed, \(-4.9t^{2}\) is a function whose second derivative is \(-9.8\text{.}\) However, we have a slight problem here. We know that \(h(0) = 100\) and \(h'(0) = 0\text{.}\) If \(h(t) = -4.9t^{2}\text{,}\) then it's impossible for \(h(0)\) to equal \(100\text{.}\) The problem here is we forgot about the arbitrary constants.</p>
<p>To get an accurate expression for \(h(t)\text{,}\) we go back to \(h''(t) = -9.8\text{.}\) Then \(h'(t) = -9.8t+C_{1}\) for some constant \(C_{1}\text{.}\) Since \(h'(0) = 0\text{,}\) this forces \(C_{1} = 0\text{.}\) So we have \(h'(t) = -9.8t\text{.}\) Now we antidifferentiate one more time to get \(h(t) = -4.9t^{2} + C_{2}\text{.}\) Since \(h(0) = 100\text{,}\) this forces \(C_{2} = 100\text{.}\) So</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
h(t) = -4.9t^{2} + 100\text{.}
\end{equation*}
