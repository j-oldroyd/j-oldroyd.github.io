<p>Consider \(f(x) = x^{2}\text{.}\) If we graph this, we get a parabola. What we'd like to do is to find a way to describe how quickly this parabola is changing at a point, i.e. find the "slope" of the parabola. One way to try to deal with this is to use <dfn class="terminology">secant lines</dfn>. Recall that the secant line through the points \((a,f(a))\) and \((b,f(b))\) has slope \(\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}\text{,}\) which is just the average rate of change of \(f\) from \(x=a\) to \(x=b\text{.}\) If \(b\) is very close to \(a\text{,}\) then the slope of the secant line through these points should be a good approximation to the "slope" of \(f(x) = x^{2}\) at the point \(x=a\text{.}\)</p>
