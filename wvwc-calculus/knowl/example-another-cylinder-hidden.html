<body><article class="example-like"><p>Consider the cylinder given by the set of all lines passing through the plane curve \(y = 3x-1\) in the \(xy\)-plane and parallel to the line in \(\RR^{3}\) defined by the equation</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\vv{r} = \dotprod{3-t,t,3}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>What does this cylinder look like? Well, we can view it as essentially a "sheet" of lines cutting through the \(xy\)-plane at the line \(y = 3x-1\text{.}\) If we try to imagine this, then this suggests that this cylinder should probably be a plane! In fact, this cylinder is exactly the plane containing the point \((0,-1,0)\) and parallel to the line \(\vv{r}\) given above.</p></article></body>
