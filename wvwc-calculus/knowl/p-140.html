<p>Although it gets more difficult to assign a physical or geometric significance to higher order derivatives, we can still derive meaning from the second derivative. One interpretation of the second derivative is as acceleration, as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/example-acceleration-from-position.html" title="Example 3.2.8: Acceleration from position">ExampleÂ 3.2.8</a>, and it turns out there's a nice geometric interpretation as well. Recall that if <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is a function then <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> represents the slope, or rate of change, of the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> Therefore <span class="process-math">\(f''(x)\)</span> represents the rate of change of the slope, i.e. how quickly the slope is increasing or decreasing. If <span class="process-math">\(f''(x) &gt;0\)</span> then the slope of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> should be increasing, leading to a u-shaped graph. Conversely, if <span class="process-math">\(f''(x) &lt;0\)</span> then the slope of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> should be decreasing, leading to an upside down u-shaped graph. This leads to the following definition.</p>
