<p><a data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-rolle-s-theorem.html" title="Theorem 4.2.1: Rolle's Theorem">Rolle's Theorem</a> is powerful because it has very general conditions for its use. However, it does require the function in question to take on the same values at the endpoints of \([a,b]\text{,}\) and this is a condition we'd like to try to relax. However, we'll try to be clever about this and use <a data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-rolle-s-theorem.html" title="Theorem 4.2.1: Rolle's Theorem">Rolle's Theorem</a> to do most of the heavy lifting for us.</p>
