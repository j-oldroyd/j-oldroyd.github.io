      The primary objects of study in the field of linear algebra and its applications are linear transformations between vector spaces.
      These linear transformations are often represented using <em>matrices</em>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>matrix</term> is a rectangular array of numbers.
          If this array has <m>m</m> rows and <m>n</m> columns, we say the matrix is an <m>m\times n</m> matrix.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The following are examples of matrices:
      <me>
        \begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \\ -3 \amp 4 \end{bmatrix}\text{ and }\begin{bmatrix}1 \amp -2 \amp 0 \\ 3 \amp -21 \amp 2\end{bmatrix}
      </me>
      The first is <m>2\times2</m> and the second is <m>2\times3</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We say that a matrix is a <term>square matrix</term> if it has the same number of rows as columns.
      <me>A = [a_{ij}] = \begin{bmatrix}
        a_{11} \amp a_{12} \amp \dots \amp a_{1n} \\
        a_{21} \amp a_{22} \amp \dots \amp a_{2n} \\
        \vdots \amp \vdots \amp \ddots \amp \vdots \\
        a_{n1} \amp a_{n2} \amp \dots \amp a_{nn}
        \end{bmatrix},
      </me>
      The <term>diagonal entries</term> are <m>a_{ii},1\leq i\leq n</m> and these form the <term>main diagonal</term> of the matrix.
    </p>
    <p>
      As important as matrices are in applications of mathematics, many computing solutions exist for handling computations involving them.
      One open source solution (included in Sage/CoCalc!) is <url href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/index" visual="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/index">Octave</url>, which is a free alternative to MATLAB.
      In the code cell below Octave is used to define the square matrix above and get its diagonal entries.
      Note that brackets must be used to contain the entries of the matrix, entries in the same row must be separated by commas (or spaces) and rows are separated by semicolons.
