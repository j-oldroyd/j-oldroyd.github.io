  <title>Vector Derivatives</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this chapter we review important concepts relating to vector functions and their derivatives.
      As in introductory calculus, the derivative may be seen as giving the rate of change of a particular quantity.
      However, the move to higher dimensions involved with vector functions allows for multiple interpretations of the rate of change of a vector function, and therefore several different notions of the derivative.
