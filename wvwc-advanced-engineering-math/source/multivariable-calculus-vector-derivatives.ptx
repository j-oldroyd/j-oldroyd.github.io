  <title>Vector Derivatives</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this chapter we review important concepts relating to vector functions and their derivatives.
      As in introductory calculus, the derivative may be seen as giving the rate of change of a particular quantity.
      However, the move to higher dimensions involved with vector functions allows for multiple interpretations of the rate of change of a vector function, and therefore several different notions of the derivative.
      These interpretations are based on combining the following three concepts:
      <ul>
        <li>The <em>gradient</em> of a scalar-valued function.</li>
        <li>The inner product (see <xref ref="definition-inner-product-and-magnitude" text="type-global" />).</li>
        <li>The <em>cross product</em>.</li>
      </ul>
      We will begin by examining the inner and cross products.
    </p>

    <title>Inner Products and Cross Products</title>
    <p>
      Recall from <xref ref="definition-inner-product-and-magnitude" text="type-global" /> that the inner product of two vectors <m>\xx</m> and <m>\yy</m> in <m>\RR^n</m> is the scalar quantity
      <me>\dotprod{\xx,\yy} = \yy^{T}\xx</me>.
      This product has several nice properties (see <xref ref="theorem-properties-of-the-inner-product" text="type-global" />), but for now we'll consider the property
      <me>\dotprod{\xx,\yy} = \norm{\xx}\norm{\yy}\cos\theta</me>
      where <m>\theta</m> denotes the angle between the vectors <m>\xx</m> and <m>\yy</m> satisfying <m>0\leq\theta\leq\pi</m>.
      An important interpretation of this property is that the inner product, and particularly <m>\frac{\dotprod{\xx,\yy}}{\norm{\xx}\norm{\yy}}</m>, is a measure of the <em>correlation</em> between <m>\xx</m> and <m>\yy</m>.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example-computing-an-inner-product">
      <title>Computing an Inner Product</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\xx = \mqty[3 \amp -4]</m> and <m>\yy = \mqty[12 \amp -5]</m>.
          Are these vectors pointed in the same direction?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We can approach this problem as a correlation problem.
          We'll estimate the correlation between <m>\xx</m> and <m>\yy</m> as follows:
          <me>\frac{\dotprod{\xx,\yy}}{\norm{\xx}\norm{\yy}} = \frac{56}{5\cdot13} = \frac{56}{65}</me>.
          Since this quantity is close to <m>1</m>, these vectors appear to be correlated and therefore point in roughly the same direction.
          <aside>
            <p>
              For any nonzero <m>\xx,\yy\in\RR^n</m>, it follows that <m>\frac{\dotprod{\xx,\yy}}{\norm{\xx}\norm{\yy}}\in[-1,1]</m>.
              Values of this quotient close to <m>1</m> imply that the vectors are correlated whereas values close to <m>-1</m> imply that the vectors are <em>anticorrelated</em>.
              Values close to <m>0</m> imply that the vectors are nearly orthogonal.
