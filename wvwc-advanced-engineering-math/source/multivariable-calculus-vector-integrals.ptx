    <title>Vector Integrals</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            Now that we have several useful ways to describe the rate of change of a vector function, we want to go in the opposite direction and determine how best to measure the <em>accumulation</em> of a vector function.
            Different notions of accumulation will be associated to the different derivatives we have access to, but each connected to one concept: the integral.

        <title>Line Integrals</title>

        <introduction>
            <p>
                An integral is fundamentally determined by two objects: the integrand and the domain of integration.
                In this section, we study integrals that involve one-dimensional domains of integration.
                Such integrals are known as <em>line integrals</em>.
                We will have a different type of line integral depending on whether our integrand is a scalar field or a vector field.

            <p>
                Consider the problem of finding the mass of a wire that follows a path <m>C</m> in either <m>\RR^2</m> or <m>\RR^3</m> given a density function <m>\rho</m>.
                As seen in calculus, the mass can be found by integrating the density.
                This leads to integrals of the form <m>\int_C \rho\dd{s}</m> which are known as <em>(scalar) line integrals</em>.
                The fundamental domain of integration for a line integral is a <em>smooth curve</em>.

                <statement>
                    <p>
                        Let <m>C</m> denote a curve in <m>\RR^n</m> parameterized by a vector function <m>\rr(t)</m> defined on an interval <m>I</m>.
                        We say that <m>C</m> is <term>smooth</term> if <m>\rr(t)</m> is differentiable and <m>\rrp(t)\neq\vb{0}</m> anywhere on <m>I</m>.
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </definition>

            <p>
                We can rephrase <xref ref="definition-smooth-curves" text="type-global" /> as follows: <m>C</m> is smooth if and only if it has a smooth parameterization <m>\rr(t)</m>.
                With this in mind, we can now define line integrals over smooth curves.
            </p>

                <idx><h>line integrals</h><h>scalar fields</h></idx>

                <statement>
                    <p>
                        Let <m>C</m> be a smooth curve in <m>\RR^n</m>.
                        Let <m>f(x, y)</m> denote a function that is continuous on some open set containing <m>C</m>.
                        The <term>scalar line integral</term> of <m>f</m> over <m>C</m> is given by the limit
                        <me>\int_C f(x, y)\dd{s} = \lim_{\Delta s\to0}\sum_{k=1}^{n}f(x_k, y_k)\Delta s</me>
                        where the points <m>(x_k, y_k)</m> are lie on <m>C</m>, and <m>\Delta s</m> gives the length of the line segment from one such point to the next.
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </definition>

            <p>
                Geometrically, we view the line integral <m>\int_C f(x, y)\dd{s}</m> as giving the area between the curve <m>C</m> in the <m>xy</m>-plane and the surface <m>z = f(x, y)</m>.
                Although <xref ref="definition-scalar-line-integrals" text="type-global" /> assumes that <m>C</m> lies in <m>\RR^2</m>, the definition can be extended to higher dimensions.
            </p>

            <p>
                The definition given in <xref ref="definition-scalar-line-integrals" text="type-global" />, while important, will not typically be used for computing line integrals.
                Instead, we will take another approach using arc length.
                The differential <m>\dd{s}</m> in the line integral formula corresponds to the arc length function along <m>C</m>.
                Therefore we may write
                <me>\dd{s} = \norm{\rrp(t)}\dd{t}</me>
                and
                <men xml:id="equation-scalar-line-computational">\int_C f(x, y)\dd{s} = \int_a^b f(\rr(t))\norm{\rrp(t)}\dd{t}</men>
                for some suitable smooth parameterization <m>\rr(t), a\leq t\leq b</m> of <m>C</m>.

                    <p>
                        First, we need to parameterize <m>C</m>.
                        This can be done using <m>\rr(t) = \mqty[t \amp t^2]</m> for <m>0\leq t\leq 1</m>.

            <p>
                Recall that <xref ref="definition-scalar-line-integrals" text="type-global" /> defines scalar line integrals over smooth curves only.
                If a curve <m>C</m> is <em>piecewise smooth</em>, which means that it can be written as the union of finitely many smooth curves <m>C_1</m> through <m>C_n</m>, then we can extend <xref ref="definition-scalar-line-integrals" text="type-global" /> to <m>C</m> as well.
                All we need to do is compute the line integral along the smooth components <m>C_i</m> and add them up:
                <me>\int_C f(x, y)\dd{s} = \sum_{i=1}^n \int_{C_i} f(x, y)\dd{s}</me>.

                <statement>
                    <p>
                        Let <m>C</m> denote the curve consisting of the line segment from <m>(-1, 0)</m> to <m>(0, 1)</m> followed by the line segment from <m>(0, 1)</m> to <m>(1,0)</m>.
                        Find <m>\int_C (2x - 3y)\dd{s}</m>.
                    </p>
                </statement>

                <solution>
                    <p>
                        We need to decompose <m>C</m> into smooth components.
                        The natural choice is to pick <m>C_1</m> to be the first segment and <m>C_2</m> to be the second segment.
                        These curves are smooth and have the following smooth parameterizations:
                        <md>
                            <mrow>C_1 : \rr_1(t) \amp = \mqty[t - 1 \amp t], 0\leq t\leq 1 </mrow>
                            <mrow>C_2 : \rr_2(t) \amp = \mqty[t \amp 1-t], 0\leq t\leq 1 </mrow>
                        </md>.
                        Now we can compute the resulting line integrals:
                        <md>
                            <mrow>\int_{C_1} (2x - 3y)\dd{s} \amp = \int_0^1 [2(t-1) - 3t]\sqrt{2}\dd{t} </mrow>
                            <mrow> \amp = \int_0^1 (-2 - t)\sqrt{2}\dd{t} </mrow>
                            <mrow> \amp = -\frac{5}{2}\sqrt{2} </mrow>
                        </md>.
                        Likewise,
                        <me>\int_{C_1} (2x - 3y)\dd{s} = \int_0^1 (5t - 3)\sqrt{2}\dd{t} = -\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2}</me>.
                        Adding these integrals together, we get
                        <me>\int_C (2x - 3y)\dd{s} = -3\sqrt{2}</me>.
                    </p>
