    <title>Vector Integrals</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            Now that we have several useful ways to describe the rate of change of a vector function, we want to go in the opposite direction and determine how best to measure the <em>accumulation</em> of a vector function.
            Different notions of accumulation will be associated to the different derivatives we have access to, but each connected to one concept: the integral.

        <title>Line Integrals</title>

        <introduction>
            <p>
                An integral is fundamentally determined by two objects: the integrand and the domain of integration.
                In this section, we study integrals that involve one-dimensional domains of integration.
                Such integrals are known as <em>line integrals</em>.
