<div class="para">The MÃ¶bius strip is non-orientable because we can't choose an unambiguous orientation for normal vectors to this surface. This is because any normal vector on the surface can be moved around over the surface in a continuous fashion until it's back at the same position it started but is now in the opposite direction. To see this more precisely, consider the point <span class="process-math">\(\rr(0,0) = \mqty[1 \amp 0 \amp 0]\)</span> on the strip. Then the normal vector can be found by computing <span class="process-math">\(\nn(u, v) = \rr_u\times\rr_v\text{,}\)</span> and it can be checked that <span class="process-math">\(\nn(0,0) = \mqty[0 \amp 0\amp 1]\text{.}\)</span> On the other hand, it's also true that <span class="process-math">\(\rr(0,0) = \rr(0, 2\pi)\text{.}\)</span> However, <span class="process-math">\(\nn(0,2\pi) = \mqty[0 \amp 0\amp -1]\text{.}\)</span> Therefore it's impossible for us to select a consistent orientation for this surface.</div>
