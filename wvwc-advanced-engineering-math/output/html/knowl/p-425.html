<div class="para">The <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-fundamental-theorem-of-line-integrals.html" title="Theorem 4.2.3: Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals">Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals</a> has another important consequence. If <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is a piecewise smooth closed curve (so its initial and terminal points are the same) and <span class="process-math">\(\FF\)</span> is conservative in a region containing <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\int_C\FF\cdot\dd{\rr} = 0\text{.}\)</span> This also has a nice physical interpretation. Recall that circulation integrals can also be viewed as work integrals, and so the result that line integrals of conservative fields over closed curves are always <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> corresponds to the physical law that the work done by conservative forces along closed curves is <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> as well.</div>
