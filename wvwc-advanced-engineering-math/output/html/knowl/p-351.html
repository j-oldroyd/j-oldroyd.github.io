<div class="para">In the force field above, the work done is now <em class="emphasis">path dependent</em>. To see why, consider two paths from <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((1,0)\text{:}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(C_1\)</span> given by the top half of the circle <span class="process-math">\((x-\frac{1}{2})^2 + y^2 = \frac{1}{4}\)</span> traversed clockwise and <span class="process-math">\(C_2\)</span> given by the bottom half of the same circle traversed counterclockwise. On <span class="process-math">\(C_1\)</span> the work done will be negative since the path tends to go against <span class="process-math">\(\ff\)</span> more than with <span class="process-math">\(\ff\text{.}\)</span> Likewise, the work will be positive on <span class="process-math">\(C_2\)</span> since this path flows with <span class="process-math">\(\ff\)</span> more than it flows against it. Since the work depends on the path taken between <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((1,0)\text{,}\)</span> the work is path dependent.</div>
