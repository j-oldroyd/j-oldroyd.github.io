Doing so, we see that the eigenvalues of <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> are in fact nonnegative and so <span class="process-math">\(U\sqrt{D}\)</span> will only contain real values. Furthermore, <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> only has <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> nonzero columns since <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> only has three nonzero eigenvalues. By removing the zero column from <span class="process-math">\(U\sqrt{D}\text{,}\)</span> we obtain a <span class="process-math">\(4\times3\)</span> matrix which we define to be <span class="process-math">\(F^T\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(F^TF = G\text{.}\)</span></p></div></body>
