</h3>
<p>Recall that a Markov process describes the evolution of one state <span class="process-math">\(\vb{x}_{n}\)</span> into a future state <span class="process-math">\(\vb{x}_{n+1}\)</span> using the matrix equation <span class="process-math">\(A\vb{x}_n = \vb{x}_{n+1}\text{.}\)</span> In such a process, the matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is a square matrix with non-negative entries whose columns sum to <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> Starting from an initial state <span class="process-math">\(\vb{x}_0\text{,}\)</span> we are often interested in whether the long-term evolution approaches a specific state vector <span class="process-math">\(\vb{x}\text{.}\)</span> In symbols, we want to determine if <span class="process-math">\(A^n\vb{x}_0 \to \vb{x}\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(n\to\infty\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>For such a vector, we should have <span class="process-math">\(A\vb{x} = \lim_{n\to\infty}A(A^n\vb{x}) = \vb{x}\text{.}\)</span> In other words, <span class="process-math">\(\vb{x}\)</span> is an <em class="emphasis">eigenvector of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> with eigenvalue <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span></em>. We call this vector a <dfn class="terminology">steady-state vector</dfn> of the Markov process.</p>
<p>Now let's suppose we model the weather with a Markov process with transition matrix</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
A = \mqty[0.33 &amp; 0.25 &amp; 0.40 \\ 0.52 &amp; 0.42 &amp; 0.40 \\ 0.15 &amp; 0.33 &amp; 0.20],
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">corresponding states <span class="process-math">\(S, C\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> (i.e., "sunny", "cloudy" and "rainy") and we use an initial state vector of <span class="process-math">\(\vb{x}_0 = \smqty[0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0]^T\text{.}\)</span> To figure out the long-term probability that it will be a cloudy day, we can try computing <span class="process-math">\(A^n\vb{x}_0\)</span> for large values of <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> See the Octave cell below. If we do so, it appears that the long-term probability of a cloudy day settles in around <span class="process-math">\(44.6\%\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>We can make this analysis more precise by looking for the steady state vector using <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">eig</code>. If we take this approach, then we see that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> has <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> as an eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector <span class="process-math">\(\smqty[0.52 &amp; 0.74 &amp; 0.41]^{T}\text{.}\)</span> This is <em class="emphasis">not</em> a state vector since the values do not add to <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> and therefore can't be probabilities. However, we can convert this into a state vector by dividing each entry by the sum <span class="process-math">\(0.52+0.74+0.41 = 1.678\)</span> which in turn gives the eigenvector</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\vb{x} = \mqty[0.3113 \\ 0.4463 \\ 0.2425]
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">confirming our earlier guess. We can also see the long-term probabilities of sunny and rainy days from this steady-state vector as well.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-eigenvalue-problems.html#example-long-term-behavior-of-markov-processes" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
